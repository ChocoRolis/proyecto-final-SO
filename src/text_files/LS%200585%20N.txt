 So he had to start learning the machine industry as well? Yes. But he wasn't at all familiar with the work? No, he had been smuggled, you know, in Sweden, so he came in smuggled on cases. So he had a little experience? He ran punch presses and hammers, you know. He didn't like cooking? No, you know, there wasn't much money in it. He made good money for the case company. And he was married when he came? Yes, he got married in... I don't know. 38, I guess. 38, I guess. Was it with a Swedish girl? Yes, she stayed here with a Swedish girl and Swedish parents. Did he live at... No, he didn't live there. How did he rent a room? He lived at the Columbia Hotel, next to the one down there. He lived with us for a while, but we took care of him. Yes. So that... Did he fill up the whole war on the work floor? Yes. But then he got the idea that he would... or was it because he came from... Well, his parents were farmers out there in the Vindelberg area. Out in Pekatanika? Yes, it wasn't quite Pekatanika, but it was closer to Pektan... closer to Vindelberg, of course. So then he got the idea that he would go and farm. So he rented a farm. He rented it from his parents? Huh? He rented it from his parents? No, no. He took another farm? Yes. Oh. But that was a job he was familiar with in Sweden, otherwise he would have... Oh, yes, sure. But he had to get out of the shop for his health. Yes, he was in sanatorium for a long time. For six months or so. Was it because of the factory? Well, it was Lungedal, you know. The big smoke? Well... Was it smoking and smoking and that? Well, that was it, but... He went back there after he'd been to the sanatorium. So he... He was at the sanatorium in Rackfjord? Yes. He got sick. So he was at the sanatorium... Who paid for it? It was free. Oh, yes. The state paid for it? The Tobacco Lawsuit Association. Yes. So it didn't cost anything? No. Were there many who were at the sanatorium? Oh, yes, there were many. Do you know if there was a difference between working in a factory or a furniture factory? Oh, yes. Was it worse at the furniture factories? Oh, yes. Was it worse to follow Lunger and stuff? Yes, that was... I worked at Rackfjord Cabinet for a while, you know. I run a drill press there. And I went back to... To Greenwich, I guess it was. And then they sold machines to Spangler and... They sent me with them. Because they were trying... Greenwich was trying to sell machines to mechanics. But they wouldn't buy them, so Greenwich got Spangler to buy them. And I went with the machines. And then during the war, there was a war. Yes, there was a war. And I used parts for artillery shells. And that was day and night? Oh, there was always three shifts. And the front team worked too? Yes, I had 50 women. At Spangler's, I was foreman. During the war? Yes, 25 on days and 25 on nights. They only worked afternoon, though. They didn't work all night. For a little bit of a while, we had three shifts, but... They didn't work with the women on the third shift. They didn't want to work three shifts, the third shift, you know. So we put them back on the second and third shift. Some worked steadies, second shift, and some shifted, you know. Yes. And they were as good workers as the men? Much better. Sure. I'll never forget the time when a gal came up to me and said, I don't want to sit in between those two girls. You had a long table, you know, where we were worrying and inspecting. I said, what's the trouble? But they don't talk. Well, I said, that's fine. You're supposed to work. You're not supposed to talk. You're here to work. So you go right back and sit there and work. She did, and she didn't like it. But she stayed. And so on, they complained. Well, they all complained, but it was the same thing all the time, you know. They used to work in certain parts and they do certain operations on them, and sometimes, you know, they pile up on the slower ones. I told the head of her, take it easy. Don't pile up on her. Just take it easy. So there was like an assembly line then? There was a burying and inspection line. They checked the parts out, you know, and buried them and inspected them. Long table there. I had, I must have had 30 women there on that one table. Then we had some that run machines. No. There was war years. So people made money then, during that time? Oh, yeah. For the times, they made pretty good money. They were not afraid to put the money in the bank? No, I suppose not. I don't know. I didn't put much in the bank. Just a few years earlier, they locked the banks up and a lot of money was lost. Yeah. You didn't have any money in the security bank? Yeah. You did? I had $300 there. You were on Broadway? Yeah. Down the street here? Yeah. So what happened? Nothing. You got them all? Never got anything. Did they go on? You never even looked at them guys. They only had $300. There was nothing. There was Truman Johnson and... Yeah....Broomstress. Hillman. Was Hillman in the two? No, I don't know. No, Hillman wasn't. Hillman wasn't in there. Yeah, they could tell. Were you here then? No. I was hardly born. Were you born in... In Sweden. In Sweden? Yeah. Oh? Where? Franderfors. In Franderfors? Oh. I was born the same year you left. Born in 28, huh? Was 10 days across the ocean. And we were in Halifax, Canada, and then down to New York, see. So you started to put a little bit money in 1931 and 32 and... Oh, well, it wasn't so big. But you didn't have a house, though? No. Oh. And quite a few lost their houses. Oh, yeah. We didn't have no house. Do you remember there was a group of Swedish socialists? Oh, yeah. They were down there on 7th Street and had meetings and... Pete Peterson? Pete Peterson. Pete Peterson. He was a Norwegian, wasn't he? Yeah. But he was a communist, yeah. He was communist. Oh, he was communist. Sure. But there was not too many involved with it. Were they afraid to... Well, there was a lot of them there in the real depression. There was a lot of them because he helped out, you know, Peterson to get people on relief and get down there and help them get the food and all that stuff. He was a pretty good leader that way. He helped a lot of people out. Yeah. Yes. So what kind of work was he doing then? He was a... I don't know. All he did was... He worked in furniture and... I don't know. What did he do? He worked in furniture places, some places. I remember him from... So he had a tough time then. He had to help people, but at the same time, he couldn't tell... Well, he didn't help them out of his pocket, I don't think. Not any money, but... He helped them to... Was he a good talker? He helped to talk, you know, for them at relief. A lot of people couldn't talk English, but Pete was very well educated. Was he born here? No, he was born in Norway. He had high school and stuff in Norway, so he learned English in Norway. He was a good teacher. Talked English. Yeah. Pete was all right. So there was one of the hardships, they couldn't speak then when they came into the Depression. Yeah, there was quite a few. Families, you know, and... Yeah, and they didn't have the guts, see? They didn't have the guts to go on relief. They probably starved. They starved, they starved. Pete got a hold of them and brought them down there. He talked for them. Did you know Pete? No, no, I didn't. He's dead now. No, he is in the... He's living. He's living. But he's not well. He is in the home. He's in a nursing home. Nursing home. He belongs to our church, so... Well, he belongs to the church. He was here just to... What happened then during the Depression? The Salvation Army, they had the soup lines. Yeah. Everybody knows that. Yeah. How about the other churches now? Well... Did they help people with the food and... They helped. They helped, like, with baskets and stuff, you know. Yeah. He brought baskets. Holidays. Holidays and things like that. Only for holidays, though. Well, it was... The soup line was every day. Oh, yeah, yeah. The Salvation Army was every day. Every day, yeah, sure. But he done a lot of good work. They sure did a lot of good work. Yeah. There isn't anybody that's done as much as the Salvation Army. No, they sure did. So you married in 1935? Five, yeah. In the Norwegian church? No. In Belvedere. We went to Belvedere and got married. In Lutheran church, though? No. We were married by Lutheran, yeah. Yeah, by Lutheran ministers. But we got married at the courthouse. In Belvedere? Yeah. We got the license there, and the minister was there. A lot of people from Rafa went to Belvedere. Yeah. It was like a little honeymoon then. Yeah, well, that's what we... Everybody went. Yeah, everybody went to Belvedere and got married. So there was some kind of fair then? There was a marriage mill. It was a marriage mill in 1935 when we got married. Yeah. Did you wait because of the Depression to get married? When did you meet? Oh, we met in 28, 29. 28? Well... I met him when he come to this country. And you went steady then for so many years? No. Not no, but I mean we knew each other. We knew each other, yeah. And went to dances. We didn't start to go steady. But you held all the wedding, though, because it was the rough times. Yeah, sure. We didn't have a... Did you work then? She worked. I worked at Sunstrand's. At Sunstrand's? Yeah, and then she worked at Elko. Then after that I worked at Elko. Sunstrand Adding moved out of town, yeah. When I got married I worked at Elko. Sunstrand moved to out east, to Bridgeport. Bridgeport, yeah, with the adding machine. Yeah. That's where I worked from the time I was... So they sold that division then? Yeah. It went out east. And quite a few went with them? Oh, yeah. Then I worked at Elko. So I quit working. After that I did... Oh, you worked after you were married to her, or did you quit then? No, I worked. For a while I worked. For a while. And then I went from... Oh, I did a lot of volunteer work. Helped people that needed help, sick. Doing rationing. I worked on the rationing board. Oh, you were interested in the politics then, or... Well, no, but they needed people to help. So what were your political affiliations? Well, I'm a good Democrat. Democrat? Yeah. How about you now, Eric? I'm a Democrat. Democrat. So you were not Hooverized then? No. My father was a socialist. Oh, he was? Yeah. Oh, so did he belong to the socialist group then? The Swedish one? He went to socialist... I went to socialist Sunday school. You came here in 1909? Right. So he was here during the 1917, and when they had the draft resistors, and some of them were... Oh, yeah, my dad was never called to the service. He was never called. But they had a parade down here. Oh, yeah. Well, my dad wasn't that kind. No. He wasn't one of these that demonstrated. Mayor Halstrom was in it. Yeah. My dad was a very good friend of Mayor Halstrom and Mayor M. Bloom. How about David Palin? David? Oh, boy, I know David. The barber? Yeah. Oh, yeah. And Harry Anderson? Huh? Harry Anderson? Harry, he sold newspapers, or socialist papers. Yeah. But there was a parade in 1917. Well, that I don't... you see, I... And some people were in prison, you know, and sent to... Oh, yeah, I remember that, but my dad was not a demonstrator, but he belonged to the socialist club. So you went to the Sunday school then? Yeah, Erik Ekbam and me and... Helga Westerlund. Helga and Esther and Vera Lindgren and... yeah. So you all went there? I was right. Every Sunday? Every Sunday. But your parents belonged not to the Norwegian Lutheran Church. Yeah. You didn't have to go to that Sunday school. No. My parents didn't belong to the Norwegian Lutheran Church at that time either. Oh, I see. Because we all joined the Lutheran... our saviors, or Norwegian Church. After we got married, we joined them. I was confirmed in Trinity Lutheran Church. That's the English. I went there to Sunday school and to confirmation. So how did you find this socialist Sunday school? You had to learn a lot of different things. Oh, we had lots of fun. So your parents brought you down there? Jaume Frickstel, do you remember Jaume? He was a teacher. Yeah. And also Halström was a teacher. Halström. Yeah. So you went there every Sunday in the morning? Saturday mornings. Oh, Saturday mornings, not on Sunday. Saturday mornings, and we had choir, and we had plays, and you know. Was that Sunday school in Swedish or English? Well, it was English. We were kids, you know. You never spoke Swedish? Well, like Frickstel and them did, because they weren't so very good at the English language, you know. Some of these leaders weren't, because they come from Sweden. David Kallin, he told me that the downfall of the socialists were because they didn't turn over to English. They kept the Swedish long. Yes, some of those Swedes, you couldn't get an English word out of them. That's true. They just didn't want to learn. No, they didn't want to learn. They wanted to, but David was very active. He sold papers, and we were friends. He's dead now, I think. No, he's still living. Is he still living? He lived in a high-rise. So David, he was not one of the teachers, though. I don't remember him as a teacher. No, he was a little bit older than you, though. Oh, yeah, he's older than I am. He's much, much older. Yeah. But anyway... We had a good group of young kids, you know. We were all kids, you know, when I went to Socialist Sunday School. Did you keep together when you were playing, even outside the school and so forth? No, because some of us went to the same schools, but not all of us. Because we were scattered all around. All around. But every Saturday morning you came down there and tore... We met at Viking Hall, and we met at Svea Sooner Hall, but that was tore down. But we used to have plays up there. I can remember one we called When the Cry Was Stilled, with Dallmer Fricksell and... Oh, there was a play? Uh-huh. Helga Lundquist was the queen, and I was her attendant. Oh, my. But that was... And we had Spencer Nelson, who is dead, but his sister, Lotta, and them are living. So this is history. Way back when. Yeah. But it never got any further, you know. I mean, the Socialists, it died out. Like Hallstrom, though. He turned around. Yeah, after he got to be... He became a Republican. Yeah, after he got to be mayor, you know. How did the people feel about that? My dad worked a lot for Hallstrom. Well, they elected him. Yeah. How could he turn around, though? I mean, against his own group? Money, I think. Money. How did the people feel about that? I mean, was it a grudge, you think? Well, I can't say that it was really a grudge, really. My dad always thought a lot of Hallstrom, you know. But I really don't know why he did it. I think a lot of it is money. Business. But you learn in Sunday school now, the Socialist Sunday school, that money wasn't even. Uh-huh. There was nothing. And he was one of the teachers. Yeah. So he followed by the wayside. Yeah. He followed by the wayside. But that Socialistic movement, it dropped, you know. Now the only one I know that is anywhere radical is Pete. And, of course, he's not well, so I mean, now he is, but. So he's dead, then. No, he's not dead. No, but I mean the... Oh, yeah, but... Idealistic... Yeah, Pete held it up, and some of these old Swedish people, until they died, you know, they... But the young people didn't take hold. I know. We went to Sunday school because there's where our parents went. I'll never forget when... No. You didn't join them, though? No. No. This was before... My stepmother cornered Pete Peterson, and she was a, what do you call it in Norway? A Republican, you know. Oh, she was? Oh, yeah. She was Republican. She came from a better family than Norway. No, but she was Republican. She had nothing to do with Socialists. No? Boy, she got a hold of Pete, and boy, oh boy, did she read a lot of him. Holy Christ. The Norwegian law. She didn't know nothing about the American law, you know. So what did Pete say then? He didn't say nothing. He couldn't say nothing because she kept talking all the time. No, Pete was... Pete is well-educated. Oh, he's... I mean... He's nobody's dumbbell. I'm not saying that. He's nobody's dumbbell, but... Yeah, he went at it the wrong way. Went at it the wrong way. Was that... was they against him when he was looking for a job, for instance? Was he known then throughout the factory? Oh, yeah. They all knew him. They all knew him. They were stopping right there in the north. But you know that Pete retired from one of our big shops here, Sunstrance. Oh, he worked there? Yeah, he worked at Sunstrance. Yeah, he got in there. Yeah. For many years. So he said to me, I remember once, because I've always been active in Sons of Norway, and we worked together with Harmony and all, you know, the Norwegians. And Pete, of course, was also Sons of Norway. And he was good to have on a committee because he was well-posted on everything, you know. Religion. I don't... you couldn't stop him on anything because he read. He read everything. Yeah. He told me one time I had a meeting at my place, and he said, Anna, he said, one thing, I was called into Chicago to the board for being communistic, but they didn't find a thing on me. He says, I got a clear, you know... Clean bill of health. Yeah. So you see, it wasn't... it was just that he got people aggravated by what he said. And if Pete would have been a little different, he would have been okay. So how about the church people now? I mean, they were... they didn't want to associate with the socialists. Well, they did, you know. Now, our minister here was here, and every time we talk, I always say, well, how is Pete? And he says, well, he says, it's sad to see Pete. He says, you just wouldn't believe how sad it is to see that man. He says, you know, I wished he was a little bit more like he was before. He said, because at least he was outspoken, he said what he meant, and he didn't hide it. I mean, he was forward with it. Pete wasn't right in many ways, but I think if he would have applied himself the right way, he would have been well-liked, and he could have gone someplace. So he kept his conviction all over the years, then? In other words, he didn't bend away from it? No, but he's a religious man, and the pastor told me just a couple weeks ago, he was here, he said, you know, he has a lovely family, and I don't know Pete's second wife. I knew his first wife, but I didn't know his second wife. But the pastor said that he has a real nice family, and she thinks a lot of Pete. She sure takes good care, and that's one thing with Pete. You never saw that man dirty. I don't care if he didn't have five cents. He was never dirty. He was clean, and he didn't cuss or carry on. He used a good language. That was one thing with Pete, you know. Was he also a teacher at the Sunday school? No. No? He was more radical, you know. How about his kids? Did they belong to the Sunday school? No, because Pete got married to this woman late in life, so I mean... So he was a communist. He didn't have any children. He was a communist then. He was more communistic, more radical, you see. And that's what I think kind of spoiled him, because he got kind of hot-headed, you know. But it wasn't that he was dumb, because he was well-read. But to be a family man now, I mean, to have four or five kids and a house and a mortgage, and the banks are folding up, you wouldn't dare be a socialist then, because every factory door would be closed for you. They would go all over town, that this guy belongs to the socialist, you know, this is it. But they didn't do that. They didn't do that. But don't you think they went around with the management, that this guy... Well, they all knew Pete anyhow, because he was always out in front. We had a couple Lithuanians that were the same. Yeah. A brother and a sister, and Pete and them, they were so much alike. But they couldn't hardly talk English, but they were socialist, they were communist. How about the Italians and the Irish and Polish, were they also socialist? I don't know anything about them. No? There was just this clique of Swedish people then. Yeah, I think so. And Norwegians, a few of them. Yeah, I think so. There wasn't very many Norwegians, but my father was, he was kind of a little political-minded. And we were with the Swedes a lot. We worked with the Swedes in factories, and so my dad got interested. And then I got to know the kids, and that's how I got in on it. Not that I believed it. But you do a lot of things when you're ten, nine, ten years old. You know? But you learned a few things that I talked to some of the others. They have good use over the years to understand certain things. Oh, yeah. Because you were taught not to steal and not to lie and stuff like that. Oh, yeah. Yes, yes. Did you read any Swedish history? No. No? No. I don't even read Norwegian. How about your customs now? Are you more Norwegian now, you think, the last part of your life than Swedish? We are Americans. Huh? We are Americans. But you keep the Norwegian customs, though, for Christmas and... Oh, yeah. Lutefisk. How about lutefisk now? Do you use drawn butter instead of the cream sauce? We don't use lutefisk. You don't? No. You mean you cannot comprehend? I'm going to have lutefisk. I want drawn butter. Drawn butter? Uh-huh. How about the Riskeniskrød for Christmas? Yeah. We don't use that. What is that? They don't use that? No. What do you use them for kind of food? Ribbe. Dibbe. Dibbe. What's your court? What's your court? Yeah. Lefse. Yeah, but that isn't even... Is that Christmas? Lefse isn't even for Christmas. Oh. That's a delicacy, you know. My mother used to do all this, but you see, I don't make it. So we just... So you have Americanized then? Yeah. It's more Americanized. Oh. Do you have any children? I have one boy. One boy. And his wife is Polish. So we kind of mix Polish and Swedish and a little bit of everything. So you have to compromise then? Yeah. Of course, Polish people use a lot of sauerkraut. But no, we just... Not your family, though. They didn't use rüttvisk either? No, not much. Not for Christmas. We never had rüttvisk for Christmas. Yes, we had it. But in Norway you got it for Christmas. No. No? No. No, it's always ribbe and kukiker. It's cooking sausage. What is dibbe? What do you call it? Ribs. Ribs. Ribs. Yeah. But pigs' ribs. But they cut them... But they cut them different, you know. They cut them much more meat on them. Yeah. I see. I remember when my dad and my stepmother was going to cut up the pig in Sweden. She wanted ribbe, you know. Yeah, but for fuck's sake, you get... Two sides of two. So she ruined the whole pig, huh? Yeah. He did. Yeah. But we have rysengryn, but we have it as a dessert, you know. I see. Sometimes my mother made, but... And we have mørkje. What is that? Norwegians. What is that? Well, you know what dibbe grita is? Oh, yeah. No, but we call it mørkje. It's the same thing. Mørkje. Yeah. Norwegians make a flatbread. My mother made. You know what flatbread is? No. My mother made it. We had cookstove years ago, you know, and my mother made it right on top of the stove. Then Christmas Eve, she cooked soup, vegetable soup. And then on meat and ham or that, you know. And then she soaked, she took this flatbread, broke it up in pieces, put it in a bowl and poured boiling water over it so it softened a little, just enough so it got soft. Then she took the broth, the fat of the soup, and poured over. And then you ate it. And you called that... Mørkje. Mørkje. Yeah. Mørkje. Uh-huh. And every Christmas Eve, then you would have your friends in, you know, invite a few in, and you'd have this big bowl. And mother would have made it, you know, and then you just take as much as you want on your own plan. That was all they served. And then if you wanted a bowl of soup, you could have soup. How about the Norwegians now? Like, you are married to a Swede here. If you come in with the Øland's people, you know, the krokkaker. Yeah. Do you eat that? Sure. Norwegians call that puttekrød. Puttekrød? Yeah, puttekrød. Puttekrød. Yeah. It's made out of potatoes. Potatoes. Same thing? Same thing. Same thing, the same way? Sure. Yeah. I'm used to that. My mother made that. But you didn't have any krokkaker in Høndsøberg? Not in Sweden, no. No. I ate it at Vega Hall, the first place I ate it. So pappa, han fikk det med frisk? Oh, ja. Det var... Well, of course, everybody wanted side pork, you know, but my mother... Side pork. Her father was a butcher in Norway. They did it a different way then than the Swedes. They butchered differently. Wasn't it funny for the third wife to come home and tell pappa that she wanted side pork? Yeah, that was a devil's creature. Little pigs were destroyed. Yeah, she destroyed everything with a sea flask. He didn't know the name? No, he didn't know. He didn't know what it was. No. But he ate it. Oh, sure. There's nothing better than those ribs. Oh, when my mother had that. But you don't get that now, you know. You have to... Well, I have it. I buy country ribs in the store. I'll never forget that. And that has a little more meat than spare ribs, you know. Spare ribs is just bone. Never forget the one Christmas, we were all three boys. My oldest brother was home, too. There was three of us boys, home. And we ate up three pigs during the winter. Two hundred pounders. We had them, we butchered them right there. Well, we had a guy do it. Yeah, three pigs, two hundred pounders. We had a big sandbar. Oh, yes. Then we had ham. We'd make it for summer, hang them up and dry them, you know. All of the salt there. Well, my goodness, when we got married in 35, we had a half a pig. Yeah. You know, and we made kukukurv and sylta. And then we had our meat, you know, for Christmas. Maybe. So, you bought that in your first house? That was... In 49. In 49. Yeah. Yeah. We should have kept that house, but the boy... You should have kept the one on Fairview. Yeah, that one we should have kept, too. You had to move into an apartment, as they say. Yeah. We lived with our son. Our son had a new family, and then he sold that. Oh, you have two children then? No. Just one? Just one. One son. And he had... He's adopted. Adopted? He's adopted. Oh, adopted, I see. Yeah. But I have two grandchildren. He was 10 months old when we got him. So then we decided just to rent. We thought we were going to go into a high-rise, you know, and we happened to get this, and this is Eric Anderson's daughter who owns this flat. Oh, she owns that? Yeah.
