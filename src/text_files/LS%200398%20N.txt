 Yeah, seven years there in Iowa. In the coal mines? Uh-huh. And then I worked nine years. Let's see. Nine years? You came to Rockforge? Yeah. What kind of work were you doing then? I worked at Rockforge. Rockforge? Uh-huh. It's a metal factory. Yeah. Broken down, you know, with big hammers. This is June 1986. I was sitting together with Fredrick Johnson, Rockford, Illinois. And he was born 1913, 4th of November, in Centralville, Iowa. So your parents, they came to Iowa from Sweden? Yeah. And that was long before you were born, or they came there? Well, not too long before, I guess. They married in Centralville, then? Yeah, they married in Centralville. So your father, he came direct from Sweden, and also your mother came direct from Sweden to Centralville? Yeah. And then they met down there? Uh-huh. Do you know the reason why they came down there? No, I don't. There was no relation before then? No. My brothers happened to be. My mother's sisters and brothers, they all lived there. Oh, they did? Uh-huh. And... So they settled right in town, then, of Centralville? Well, I think they lived in town. How far away are the coal mines now, or were they? Are they from here now? No, I mean from Centralville, they're not in the country. How far? Oh. Well, they weren't very far. They were just the edge of town. So it was easy to walk to work, then, from... Well, I think they walked to work. I'm not sure. And then you were born down there, and you also started to work in the coal mines? No. We moved from there. They started the sinking mines. And we moved from there up to... North to the Des Moines area? Yeah, towards Des Moines. Wapaloo? No. Dallas and Melcher. And then we lived there for a while, and then we moved up to... Waukee, where you saw a couple of coal mines. I see. And... Were they deep? About 300. Oh. Uh-huh. They were pretty good. Yeah, they were pretty good-sized mines. And the coal they broke out of there now, was it good anthracite or hard coal? Yeah, it was... Pretty good grade. Yeah, pretty good grade, yeah. But it was Rock Island Coal Mine there in Dallas and Melcher, and then just south there a little bit was... Jerry Buckle, line two, please. Rock Island Coal Mine at Williamson, Iowa. And he sank the coal mine there. Oh. So there you worked for seven years? Yeah, several years, seven. Did you move with your family then back to Rockford, or did you...? Yeah. My dad died in 49, so he didn't move back with us. I see, so you stayed down there. Yeah. We moved him back to Iowa, to Centerville. You mentioned that you were growing up with your grandma. Was she your father's mother, or...? Well, she just lived with us for a little while. She came from Sweden then? Yeah. Oh, wow. Yeah, she got chips in her eyes from chopping wood, you know, and that slowed her up. So she moved over there to Iowa, and she died also there in Centerville, no? Well, she moved to... To Minnesota? Uh-huh. And an aunt and uncle lived up there. She lived with them there for a while. And your grandma's, what was her name? Huh? What was her name, grandma? Johnson. Johnson. Was that the first name? I can't think of it. Can't think of it. Did you belong to the Lutheran church down there, or the covenant? Or was it the Swedish church down there? Well... There was two of them. We... Went to a Christian church, really. A Christian? Uh-huh. There was no Swedish then? Huh? There was no Swedish? No. No? No. There was a Methodist and a Christian church where we lived. And then when you came back, and you come up this way to Rockford, did you... I still stayed with the Christian church. Christian church? Mm-hmm. Did you belong to any of the lodges here, like Viking, Vasa, or Switzer? No. No? No singing club, or? No. No church. So... So if you compare the work now with the coal mining and the metal work in Rockford Forge, which one was the toughest battle, you think, that you... Well, I would say the... The metal work was really... Was it hard? Hard work, yeah. But you stayed with it for seven years? Huh? You stayed with it for seven years? Well, I... I've been in... No, I... I came from Rockford up here and stayed with it about seven years. Then I went into independent business in my own service station. In Rockford? Yeah, for 28 years. 10th Street and Broadway. 10th Street and Broadway. 10th and Broadway. The whole time. So... For 20 years. My leg got bad this winter, so I gave it up. Retired for good. Mm-hmm. Have you been back to Centerville, the area where you were born? Oh, yeah. Do you still have a relation down there that way? Not anymore. They all came here except your father? They all moved up here. So you repaired cars also, as well as pumping gas? Yeah. If you compare where you started 20 years ago, was it easier then or easier in the later years to run a business? Well, it's more competitive now. You're in more... Well, in order to make a living, you have to get into more competitive business. And a larger volume to sell gas to make money on it, I suppose. Pardon? You have to sell more volumes. Yes. Oh, yeah. Sure. A lot more now. And the cars, they break down as often as they did years ago? Yes, they do. Yes, they do. Is it more complicated nowadays to fix them than it was... Well, in a way, yes. Yeah. You have more of a... Well, you might say there's more things going wrong with the car now. Like the rear end going out and stuff like that. Clutches. Of course, you're getting away from clutches now because they're getting away to the four-wheel drive and stuff like that. So it adds more... Huh? It adds more service. Yeah.
