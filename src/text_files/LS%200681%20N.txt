 This is tape number three. Page number one is a continuation of John Johnson. Rockford, Illinois. Tape three. Side one. Light and... Is he still living? Yeah, he's still living. And he lives......in Guildford. Guildford? Guildford. He lives just... Not too far from here? Yeah. I don't know. That'll be over there. Over there someplace. That's probably... Oh, that might be......ten, fifteen blocks from here. Yeah. He's... He's been in the electric company downtown. I guess he... For the city? He was there for a good many years. Ever since he went to school. That's the first job he had. And he's been having that all the time. Now I think he retired, so he don't work at all now. Did you go to school when you first came here? To night school? No, I went to night school. You did? Yeah. And monkeyed around for a long time. I had to pick up the language some way. I don't know how good I'd made it, but I could... I could write letters. Now I can't write anything. But you have a good eyesight, though. Oh, yes. You can see all right. Yeah. I had a good eyesight. I'm not missing anything that I know more about Heinzel's. That's all. So you've been very healthy then over the years. You never had any sickness of any... I've been sick, too, but... You pulled through. Yeah, pulled through. One time I had a... He said my heart was swelling. And I was at Rockford Memorial Hospital in downtown. And he took me down there one Sunday. And the next Sunday, he took me up to the restaurant. That was when I had a restaurant. It was out west one time. And I worked on a railroad by Snake River. Oh, Idaho. Huh? You've been on Idaho? You've been in Idaho? No, that's in Washington State. But Snake River is in Idaho also. There ain't no Snake River in Idaho. It isn't? No. I thought there is one. No, maybe there is. I'm sure there is. Or you're in Washington State. But the Snake River that I worked with... Was in Washington. That's in Washington, south of Spokane. Yeah, and what year was that? Was that before you... 19... 1913. What kind of idea was that? Why did you go west? Somebody told you? They called it Herman. Herman Railroad. I never heard it after that. You went first, huh? No, I don't think so. But you went out there? Yeah, I went out there. And worked on the rail? Yeah, that was 1913. Were you alone then from Rockford? No, we were six guys. Six guys? Yeah, and we took a job and... and cleared off some money feet of stuff for the railroad. Oh, you went ahead of the railroad? Yeah. To clear land? Huh? You mean you cleared the land for the railroad to lay the tie? Yeah. I see. And they called it Herman. I never heard of Herman Railroad. But it must be there because... And it was going beside the Snake River or close to Snake River? Yeah. Yeah, Snake River was... We had our camp right by the Snake River. You could do a lot of fishing there? Yeah, I didn't. I didn't do any fishing there. No? No. I was tired. You were tired? I was tired digging all that. There was not stone, but there was sand. Tagged sand with like water. Water had moved the sand up, you know, and I was sore. It was tough? So tight and so hard. You couldn't hardly pick it. So we had to make little holes and put dynamite in there to loosen up some of it. So we got most of it for rock. So you had to level it off then? Yeah. No machinery? No. Only by hand? No, no machinery. How much were you paid then? Huh? How much were you paid for a day's work? Well, we had it on contract. We were eight guys. And we took a piece. All Swedes? A piece. I don't know how long that piece must have been. But, oh, it was about a... A couple of miles? About a, no, a block, block long, something like that, that's what it must have been. And we took that down. We were six, six fellows from Rockford and one from Wisconsin. So we were five from Rockford and one from Wisconsin. Six guys? Yeah. All Swedes? All Swedes, no, no. The one that was from Wisconsin, he wasn't Swedish, but he had a family in Wisconsin. And he didn't have too much work, I guess, where he stayed, so he thought he went with us. And he was a pretty good, he had a knowledge of hard drills and stuff like that, so he got a little money for that, too. So how did you get this job? Through an ad in the paper or...? No, we didn't have any. We just went there. On railroad? Yeah, and they were glad to give us a job because they were hard to get, to get people to come. Who was figuring this job now? Huh? Who was figuring this job now, how much pay you were going to get? You took in the piecework, you said? Yeah, they had a man, engineers, that gave so much and told how there was, whether there was rock or whether there was dirt. We had sand that was worse than anything because that was packed so hard that you couldn't get a pick in there. And then what we had to do, we tried to pick a little hole so far deep in that rock or that stuff and then put a dynamite in there to loosen it up. Did you have to buy the dynamite, too? Yeah. You had to figure out the whole job? Yeah. How did you come out? Yeah, we come out, I had $300, whenever the thing was paid on my part. How long did it take for you to clean the... Oh heck, we was there three months, I guess, something like that. So you made pretty good money then? Yeah, well we made pretty fair. How about the cooking? Huh? How about the cooking now? How about taking care of your house? Oh, they had a camp there. They had a camp? Oh yeah, they had a big camp there. You had to pay for the food there? Oh sure, we had to pay for that. How did you like it out there? There was a different climate than Rockford. Yeah. Did you like it out there? I don't know, I don't think so. You didn't like it? Oh hell no. Yeah, but it's beautiful, the Snake River. Huh? It's a beautiful country there, the Snake River. Yeah, that's beautiful, and there's a lot of snakes, you know, rattlesnakes. Oh, you had that? Yeah, we killed quite a few rattlesnakes. Yeah, they're tough. So then after you were finished, you headed all back? Yeah. To Rockford? Yeah. I didn't feel good there. No? Yeah, but you know when you eat, and they had some sauce with sweet stuff, you know, and when they dug right up in a table, dinner table or so, then these little black ants, they are so small, and their plates were just full of them darn ants. And you were liable to get something from them in your mouth. I don't know what the hell it was, but I got sick there. So I couldn't do any hard work. I had to use a horse and take care of the horse. We had a horse to pull the dirt away and all that stuff. So? It was one experience you had. That was a lot of hard work. That was no small thing. We went to Walla Walla. Oh yeah, there's a big prison there. Yeah. There was a prison there at that time too? Yeah, there was more of a big fruit stuff. A lot of apple growers there. Yeah, yeah. Sure. Yeah. Washington apple. Huh? Washington apple. Yeah. The big delicious apple. Yeah, yeah, everything. And we went there for July, that I can remember. And going there, we happened to go on a railroad. And when we went, we found a rattlesnake. And that rattlesnake, he went under the rail in between the ties. And there he laid, so you couldn't hit him. So I went down in the bank and got a few stones, but so big. You hit him with the stone then? Yeah. And then he crawled out of there. And the rest of the boys, they had a big rock, but so big. And then he threw that right on the snake after I got out of that hole under the rail. What happened if somebody got stung by those rattlesnakes? Oh, they are tough. Could you live long enough to get to the hospital? Oh, I suppose so. It never happened to anybody though? No. Did you have gloves on your hands? Huh? Did you have any gloves or work gloves? No. You never used work gloves? Used the hands. How about your feet though? Did you have leather boots? No, we didn't have any. We only had regular shoes and that's all. That's all? Yeah. And so, all of them had some coyotes that built a hill or mountain probably before they got too far in. And then they had to shoot that out and make a road there and off. So you could plan it out? Yeah. I went home to Rockford. Alone? Yeah, alone. And they went up to Canada to build another railroad up there. I see. For Herman Railroad? Yeah. Herman Railroad? Yeah. So, they got, I think it was seven. Let's see. One from Wisconsin and five from Rockford you said? Huh? One from Wisconsin and five from Rockford. It was six of you then? Yeah. Yeah, I guess so. And that was the last trip out west? Yeah. You never went back out there? No. That's the first time I had lice. You had, it was in a camp then? No. We lived in Nebraska in a hotel. And I got lice there. And I killed them in Snake River. I don't know. How did you do then? I don't know. You didn't take a bath? Yeah, I took a bath. And I washed all my clothes. And they disappeared, all of them. That's the first time I had lice. Oh, God. I thought that was terrible. But how was the camp though out in Snake River? Was the camp clean? Oh, yeah. The camp? Yeah. They always complained about those camps. Yeah. Yeah, but that was clean. Did you do your own washing? Yeah. We had to do our own washing. On Saturdays or Sundays? Yeah. Everything. Everything we had to do ourselves. How many hours did you work then when you worked for yourself? Oh, sometimes we worked ten hours as a rule. And sometimes when it was real hot, we probably worked an hour or so afterwards. And took the heat in the shade, something like that. Because you got hot out there? Yeah. We, yeah, there was quite a gang. There was, I don't remember all the names now. But there was one Carlson and three Johnson and, what the heck? I can't remember. There was one from Wisconsin. He was kind of handy with hardening. So he always fixed the… Sharpened your bits? The bits up. Drill bit. Yeah. Did any of those guys come back from Canada or you… Huh? Those guys, now they went to Canada. Did they come back here to the United States again or what happened? Oh yeah. They come back after they were… They built a railroad in British Columbia up in Canada. And they come back here after that. I got so tired of it. I thought to hell with it. I'm going to go to Rockwood. You didn't like the kind of life, huh? To rough it? Yeah. Well, it was too much of it. No fun. No fun. I was just all hard work. Hard work. So… Did you meet any roughnecks? Huh? Did you meet any roughnecks during that time? Yeah, but some way I didn't have any trouble with any of them. Were you…? There was one Indian. Indian, he was… Him and I wrestled one time. Oh. Because he couldn't do anything with me. He couldn't? No, he had never wrestled before. And I had been wrestling and I didn't care to throw him or anything like that. I just wanted to show off and take holds and do little tough stuff with the partner. Do you remember Swan Hilleman? Swan Hilleman? Yeah. He was a strong man. He ripped phone books apart and horseshoes and everything like that. Yeah, I can remember. You remember that? Yeah. Did he do that here in Rockford also? Yeah, but I never met him. You never saw him? No, but there was a fellow that started the screw part company. Eric Anderson? No. No, there was Hilleman. Hilleman? Yeah, Swan Hilleman. Yeah. Yeah, I know them. He also went on to the Swedish gym. Yeah, yeah, he was there. I know him pretty well. First, when I met him, he had a motorcycle and he drove a motorcycle. He had a wife or a girl, I don't know which, and she was always sitting with him. She was sitting in the back and holding her on him. Oh, I see. So he had a motorcycle? Yeah. Yeah. That's all I remember. Was he a wrestler too? No, but he took pieces and turned them. I don't know how many books or how that was. He could tear them. Or rip them apart. Yeah, rip them apart. Tear them apart. And then people were laughing and clapping their hands. Yeah. So did he appear on any circus that came to town? Huh? Did he belong to any circus or anything that was traveling around? No, no. You don't remember that? No, I don't remember that. But he came from Chicago. He used to be in Chicago and he came here and then he started that... Screw product. Screw product. So have you missed your old country now, like Kroksmåla? Yeah. Were you homesick the first time? Well, I've never been home since 1912. I know, but have you been homesick? No. There was nothing you missed? No. No, nothing especially. No? No. Yeah, but one guy by... I think his name was Jack, Jack Johnson. He was a little, not a very big boy, but he was a strong little thing. He used to box. And if he had been keeping that up, he would have been champion, I think. So he was good? Yeah, he was good. He used to go down to West Side, him and I, and work out twice each week when I was young. Twice each week. So you sparred against each other then, sparring partners? Yeah. How about, were you running anything during that time? Huh? Were you also running to get in condition for it? How did you get your strength? Did you lift a lot of weights? Yeah, I lifted a lot of weights. You did? Yeah. And running? Yeah, I could stay up like that 95 pounds. On one arm? One hand? Either way, either way to my left or my right. And a dumbbell weighed 205 pounds, I think. I could take that and push that up. That's the hardest lift I... You're over 100 kilos. Yeah, 205 pounds. Yeah, well... 212, you know, is 100. Yeah, well, that's the way most of them, they don't try to say, to go slow. They give it a little push and that helps a heck of a lot, I'm telling you. It's harder to go slow. Yeah. That's what takes the power. Yeah, I could lift 95 pounds with either arm. How many rounds did you box now? Five or six? I don't... I didn't box at all. Only for practice? Yeah, just practice. That's four, four per minute, I guess. It's supposed to be... No, three minutes each round. Oh, and is it three? Three. I thought it was four. No, three. Yeah, well... How many belong now to the Swedish gym when you started it? Huh? How many members were you in the Swedish gym when you started it? Oh, God, we must have been... 50? Pretty close to it. Most young fellas on 7th Street belong to that Swedish-American club. But now, lately, I... They used to have it up on Broadway someplace. The last I heard was in Broadway, 9th Street and 15th Avenue, I think it was. They used to have a day club. But Christ's sake, that must be... Well, I must have been around 20, 25 years old when I used to be in the game of wrestling and gymnastics. How long did you continue? You were 35 up in the 40s when you stopped? No, I quit right after I got married. You didn't do a thing then more? No. I was married 25 years... 29 years. 29 years I was... Well, you were married in 1916, you said. Yeah. Yeah, maybe that's it. So you quit then after that? Yeah. My wife didn't like me go out and monkey around, so I quit. She couldn't see it the same way as you did? Yeah. She liked the fish, though. Oh, she did? Oh, God. Yeah. She liked the fish just as well as I did. And she caught a lot of big fish, too. Do you think that during the Depression, when it was a hard time here in Rockford, do you think the Swedish gym was a good thing for the boys to have? Yeah. To hang out, I mean, to talk things over? No, that was a good thing because there was a lot of... The hardship. A lot of work out and had a good... They were all in good health. And they played soccer against Chicago and La Salle, Mourinho? Yeah. But you didn't play soccer too much, you said? I was in playing sometimes, but not any games because I wasn't good enough for that. Do you remember if they had any minute books from those meetings? No. What happened to them? That I don't know. Do you remember if they had any minute books from those meetings? No. What happened to them? That I don't know either. I don't know it. There's nobody that you remember that belonged to it? Yeah. There were some that were in the USA. Yeah. And they were all in the US. Yeah. And they were all in the US. Yeah. And they were all in the US. Yeah. And there were some that had them and they kept them. And the club seems to change so much and go out to nothing. And in a little while it started up again. And in most cases they couldn't get the housing they wanted. So there was trouble. Yeah. Yeah. They had some place on 7th Street in the alley of 4th and 5th. And in the alley there was a different old house they had for a gymnasium. And they had a mat there and had a little riggler. And then there was one building that was between 2nd and 3rd, 3rd Avenue. And this here was on the east side of 7th Street. And we had that place for a gymnasium and stuff like that for some time. You didn't belong to the Vega gym club? Huh? Vega, the Temperance, they had a gym club? Yeah, I guess I was the one. Vega too? Yeah, Vega. Eric Johnson, you remember him? He was the leader. Yeah. I think that's the one that took over after I quit going. I see. Yeah. So you remember Eric Johnson? I can't recall him now. He died a year ago. Oh, did he? He was in Tidaholm. Yeah, yeah. He was the leader for the Ling Gymnastics. Yeah, yeah. You know all about that. Well, I heard about it. Huh? Well, some of them have told me what happened. Yeah. So do you remember Cy Lindstrom? Huh? Cy Lindstrom. Cy Lindstrom? He was a gymnast. I don't know the name. No? I probably do. I probably did know him. But there was many that afterwards I got married. Then I quit all that gymnasium stuff. And now that is... That's history. That's history. Home in Sweden, were you engaged with anything of an athletic... No. Soccer or wrestling? No. Never. Never? No. There was no club in Kroksmola? No, nothing. Nothing at all? When you were... you had to work and that's... And the old people were not for that either? Yeah. You were not running out in the woods? Huh? You were not running out in the woods, for instance? All it was to work when you could work and that's all. Make some little money and... How about hunting and fishing? No, fishing I liked. You did in Sweden too? Oh, yes. I used to snare them, you know. Oh, jädder? Yeah. I used to snare them with a fine wire, you know, and have that on the end of a long pole. Then I had a big hole or a round thing on the pole and when I got the snare around their ears, then I pulled. And they walked? Yeah, then I pulled. Otherwise, if you got too far back, then they slipped right off. So the water was clear enough so you could see them then? Yeah, yeah. Och det var jädder? Yeah, det var jädder. Och då hade du pepparot och potater? Ja, det var... They dug... There was pretty good water there and they dug down so that was on the Seemusa River. And you know, Emhon and Alsterhorn, Alsterhorn I think is where Alsterbro, Alsterbro is. That's what I'm told. And Emhon, that was further north. That was... I can't remember the names now, goddamn. Many years ago. Yeah. And I... Yeah, I used to snare them. I used to go around the rivers or creeks or whatever and when I saw one of them, jädder, then I went so quiet and carefully and I got near enough so I could get my pole where she was standing and then I pulled that wire just over the head and then I gave a little jerk and off she go. If you let her go a little further than that, then she slid right off. Was it a wire or was it twine? Wire. Wire? Yeah. The snare? Yeah. And it worked? Yeah. Oh yeah. I snared a lot of them. That was the first... Adventure. But no hunting? Huh? You didn't hunt anything? No. No. All I... Scared of some moorkuller. Oh yeah, in the month of May. Yeah. They fly fast. Yeah. And they come in the evening, just about when the sun got down a little bit, but it was still light and then they flew over. If you had a gun then you should shoot them. And I forgot what the heck they got. They got quite a bit of money for them. And they wasn't any bigger and about that long. Yeah, it was like a pigeon, you know. Yeah. A little bit skinnier maybe. Yeah. So how about, do you remember, if you run around with the poskbrev? What? Poskbrev. Poskbrev? No, brev. Poskbrev. I can't remember. Inga poskbrev i kroksmåla. No. No? I can't remember that. No? Yeah. You don't remember if they did something else there? They were singing at Christmas? Singing carols around the farms? You didn't... No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. You didn't... No. I can remember that time, but I don't remember if anybody was doing anything. No. No. Well, you remember when you came here, Halloween? Yeah. There was the night when they had all the pranks. Yeah. You know, outside the outhouses and everything. Yeah. You didn't do things like that in Sweden? Well, when you're talking about that, they used to have outhouses, you know. Yeah. And if you didn't look out, they tipped the outhouses over. In Sweden? No. Here in Rockford? Here in Rockford. But never in Sweden? No, not in Sweden. But here they did? Yeah. But here in Rockford. And I know where I lived, that guy, he had an outhouse and a little other place that he had a lot of stuff in. And he had watched that outhouse all night till about two or three o'clock in the morning. And as soon as he went in, somebody tipped that over. And I thought that was a dirty shame. Yeah, but there must have been older people doing that, though. Oh, sure. You're not kids. No, no. There was older boys. But I thought that was an awful thing. And then after you didn't look out, they probably filled in that stuff. Somehow they filled in that stuff when they tipped it over, you know. Do you remember if there were a lot of houses that had chickens in the backyard at that time? Yeah. Chicken coops? Yes. Quite a few. Yeah. Did they also in Rockford write it on here when you came? No, no. But they were on the outskirts farms. Yeah, yeah. Even my, Oscar Carlson, my brother-in-law, he used to go hunting, you know, many times. Yeah. And I went with him and probably chased some of them up, and he shot them. Sometimes we had three, four rabbits. We was eating rabbits. I got so tired of rabbits that I don't want to see them. There was too much of it. Yeah. So now you are spending your time here at P.A. Peterson's home here in Rockford. Yeah. Now that's the last I guess I... It's a nice home here, though. Oh, yes. That's nice. And you remember P.A. Peterson? Yeah. Yeah. I thought he used to come... To your store....come in where I worked. I was working in a glass factory, and there was... Maybe he owned it. Huh? Maybe he owned it. Yeah, he was a stockholder there. He was a stockholder in almost every shop here in town. Oh, yeah. And he come on 18th Avenue between 9th Street and 10th Street and walked in the zero weather and only had a silk coat on, and sometimes he was bareheaded. And I thought he was crazy. That was first I know P.A. Peterson. Why did he dress himself like that? He could afford to have an overcoat. Oh, sure, but that's what he liked to do, I guess. But those are only little ways. Little better than probably... From 9th Street until 10th Street, that was only one block. But he always walked like that, even up in high H. Yeah, yeah. What kind of cigars was he smoking? I don't know if he ever smoked. I don't think he ever smoked. No. How about Levine Faust? Do you remember him? Huh? Levine Faust. Oh, Levine Faust. He was... I don't know about the smoking, though, but Levine Faust, he... What happened to him after the collapse of the hotel and the whole thing? I don't know. I don't know what happened to him. He was running the mechanic factory one time. I happened to be out of a job, so I asked for a job, and he gave me a job inspecting, inspecting pieces. But I didn't stay very long, because I thought that was a silly thing. But they had to be, I guess, right on the button when they ground the pistons and all that stuff for knuckle joints and stuff like that. That was right on. Had to be right on the thousand. And I didn't stay very long. But otherwise I was there. And there was one guy coming from some other place, and he was supposed to be boss there. And I was inspecting after the grinder, and I think it was sometime the grinder made a little too much, took off a little bit too much, and that had to be so. And that was one that's when they ground the pin, you know. Right on that. That was pretty hard to inspect that stuff, just because half a thousand or something like that, they didn't let that go. Or a thousand, I don't remember now. But I was inspecting that stuff. I thought that was crazy. But that was correct, because if they had two thousand too much, then they could do it over again, but if they had less, then they couldn't do it. Then they had to throw it away. Rejects you. So if you go back in time now, they always talk about the good old times. Were there really good times? Were there tough times? That all depends on what you call a good time. You liked the fishing part, though? I liked the fishing, yeah. But I mean in your daily work now, was it a hard job? Were you tired when you came home from work? It didn't make no difference. I didn't go when I had work. You were never off from work? No, but I liked to take a week's vacation. When did you do that? When did you start with a week's vacation? After the Second World War? I did that many times. And then I went up clear up to Rice Lake, Wisconsin. Long Lake. You probably heard about that. Oh, yeah, I've been there. Yeah, there was a lot of Rockford people that had houses there in Long Lake. So you rented a house then? Yeah, we rented a house or stayed in some place. Were you paid for that week of vacation then? Yeah. You were paid then for a week? I was paid for a week. But only one week? Yeah. No more? No, no more. The other, if we went, we had to either pay for the cell or leave it to go. Do you remember when somebody died, for instance, now? If you took off a day from work to go to a funeral, that happens very often years ago, they went to a funeral of their friends. Were you paid then by the factory? No. It was your own? They weren't paid. If they were caring, they did. I see. Then the company paid for it, because that only took a half a day, that's all. Oh, I see. I don't know how they do it now, but that's the way they used to do it. You had to go home and get dressed and go to the funeral home and stay there until it was all over. Then after the person that was there, if he had worked there, they got the... Then they'd get time off? They got the time off. And the big undertakers here in Rockford, there was Fred Olson and Collins Somburg. Yeah, yeah, because they probably was after I was mayor. No? I don't know. I mean undertakers now. Yeah. Undertakers. Yeah. Yeah, that was many, I guess. Some years ago. Yeah, that's right, that's some years ago. And that was the end of the interview with Joseph Johnson, Rockford, Illinois. End of interview. And we have today, 22nd of April, 1987.
