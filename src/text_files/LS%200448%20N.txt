He was, had cancer. I see. So he was pretty bad. So you went to school then in Rock Island? Yeah. All your schooling here? No, I had to quit after two years. In high school or? Uh-huh. Why did you? Well, I wasn't able to keep it up. I see. So that's, I was no good. Oh, I tell you, we had a young, young, young, and he came over to see us. He said, could I send Dorothy upstairs for a little while? And so I went upstairs. And he says, when I come down, he said, I decide to ask your folks if you could quit school. You're not supposed to quit if you've only been there two years. It was in high school? Yeah. But it was hard for me. Couldn't memorize or anything. You couldn't? No. I'm no good. You had no memory.

Everything. You just took care of the houses then? I could never do it again. Well, I suppose that age takes its due toll, as they call it. Yeah. So, and you never married? No. You could never find the right guy? Didn't want to. You didn't want to. Was it, did you like to do housework? Oh, yeah. You stayed in the home then? Thirteen and a half years in one place, and fourteen years in another place. So you stayed right on the premises? Yeah. Had a room there, and had your day off on Thursday? Yeah. But didn't you feel that you were boxed in, or you couldn't do what you wanted? No, because I had my whole full day. And you were paid pretty decent too, or? They didn't pay you very much, but I survived. And so you had your last job here in Moline then? Yeah. Moline, Moline. Did you belong to a church? Well, I've been to many churches, because I lived in Chicago. But now I live, belong to First Lutheran. In Rock Island? In Rock Island, up on the hill. But when you're not able to go, you can't go.

He's not at that church anymore. But he and I, we were just like, we were related. Who was that? Pastor. Isn't that funny? I can't, it may come to me. So Calvary church, that was on 60, around 60th, 61st? Something like that. So you belonged then to that one for several years? Oh yeah. And you worked in an American family? Yeah. You never worked for Swedes? Uh-uh. They didn't hire any maids? Oh yeah, some of them did, but they didn't think I knew how to cook. You're sweet. But I got along. But the Americans liked your cooking? Uh-huh. You had no trouble? Never. See, my mother's a wonderful cook. And she taught you how to do it? No. And I was, when I was younger, I was not well. So she just let me go, you know, do as I please. Take it easy. And I got... I wish I didn't forget everything. Did you have TB or anything like that? No? No, not then. But you were skinny and... I've always been thin all my life. I see. So your mother liked you to have it a little bit easier then? Yeah. She didn't, she babied you a little bit? No, she didn't baby me. I had to work there too. At home? When I was home. So... but that's the way it goes. So, did you belong to any Swedish organizations as you talk about? Oh yeah, I belonged to Vasa. I belonged to Vikings. Not anymore though. The Vikings I still belong to. Vikings. And... What's the other one? Vasa and Vikings. Well, the other one I quit a long time ago. But the Vasa and Vikings I...

So you had your evenings off then? Oh yeah. Could go wherever I want. A lot of horse work people, you know, they had to work late hours. Yeah. But you didn't have to do that. No, I didn't have to do that. So you had it better that way then. So how did you like not to live in Chicago? Was it a good time? Well, it was alright then, but not now. It was rough. So many Polacks and people moved in. So I moved back here. To Rock Island? So you worked here in the last few years before you retired? No. You didn't? You retired then? I quit. Oh, you came from Chicago. But your parents, you said, you can't remember where they are or you have no... I can't remember the place. They must be very old then. Well, Dad's about 86. He's got to be more than 86. Well, I don't remember their age. So he worked at Augustana? But they don't have that. You didn't work at Augustana at all? No, thank goodness. You mean there was not a good place to work at? Oh yeah, it was good, but I mean... You didn't have to... I had to do housework. Oh, is that better you think than working? Yeah. So you have done a lot of cooking then in your... Oh yeah. So you went back, no, you visited Sweden in 1961? 63. 63. At home? I had a friend. Oh, I couldn't go alone. So she asked me if I wanted to go. I said, I sure do, just so I could see where Mother and Dad came from. And you are sure they came from Stockholm, both of them? Oh yeah. Did you know the street where they were born? No. Well, Dad was on the south side and Mother was on the north side. But didn't your parents tell you where to go and look for their birthplace? They were not around. They didn't know I was going. And you didn't let them know? Uh-uh. Why? Well, because I didn't get a chance. My friend in Chicago asked me to go and I wrote to my sisters and they said, by all means, you go. So that's what we did. So you were able then to converse in Swedish when you came home? Oh yeah. Did you meet your uncles or aunts? Yeah, I met Dad's brother. In Stockholm? Yeah. And then I met my aunt in Stockholm. But then I was with this other friend. She said, you're going to go traveling. So we traveled. Went to Ã–stersund. Oh, north Sweden. Mm-hmm. North and port. So how did you find Sweden then? Was it something... Beautiful. Just gorgeous. But your parents never talked too much about it? No, because my sisters wouldn't listen to Swedish. They didn't understand Swedish? Uh-uh. But you did? Oh yeah. I went to Swedish school at Augustana. Just so I could learn it. So were you the oldest one then of the... The children? Yeah. The children. So the next two ones, they didn't have to speak Swedish? No. They had to... No, they didn't care for Swedish at all. They dropped it. Like your parents now, did they talk Swedish among themselves? No. Oh yeah, among themselves. And to you? The only thing we remembered, what we were going to get for Christmas, see, in our house there was radiators in the floor. Yes. And Florence says, I think I'm going to get a doll for Christmas. My mother said, I thought she didn't know Swedish. So that was that. So that she was able to pick up a few words then. Oh yeah. Oh. So you remember the Christmases in the early years? Hm? Your parents, they had Christmas... Oh yeah. Something like in Sweden, you think? Well, no, but they had... Christmas tree? Swedish decorations. They had? Decorations from Sweden? No, we had... you can buy them here. But they were Swedish. Yeah. And light candles. No, we didn't have light candles. No? We had lights. Electric lights? The small ones. Oh. But there was a real Christmas tree? Oh yeah. A spruce? I don't know, I couldn't tell you. It's so long ago. And then your mother prepared the lutefisk and the sylta. Don't make me sick, I love it. Delicious. Were you able to learn to do those things? No, I couldn't do it. Not the Swedish, except... The families you worked for, they didn't care about the lutefisk? No. They did do meatballs and things like that, but no lutefisk or anything. So for Christmas, now, did you go home then? No, I couldn't go home. You stayed in Chicago? Yeah. So you didn't see your parents for many years then? No. Yeah. So there was... Like the large meetings, Viking and Warsaw, did you participate often in those meetings? Oh yeah, I had jobs and that. You had jobs, yeah. And Vikings, I'm still president. I've been president. Well, first I went in as a Supreme President. And then after that, I came down here, and I've been in five years. And I'm still president. Oh, the Viking Lodge? Yeah. In... Morley. Oh, Clara Lodge. No. That isn't the Viking. That's just the... I don't know what they call it, but I belong to Thora. Thora Lodge.

The homes? Different homes. Of course, now I can't, but they're going to come and get me one day. Hello. Can I ask who you are? So your parents are both dead then? Yeah. Many years ago, in the 50s. But the Thora Lodge now, why didn't you join the Clara Lodge? No. That is not... Two ladies lodges then. That is not like Thora. It's two different lodges. But they don't belong to the Vikings then? The Thora? Yeah, Thora does. But I don't know about Clara. Oh, you never belong to Clara? No. So you meet in members' homes then? Yeah. See, to belong costs a lot of money. And I couldn't keep it up. I see. But I never joined. How about this Thora Lodge now? Do you charge membership to them? Oh, yeah. We pay every month. Or every year I pay it mine. They don't want me to quit. So, then of course I was Supreme President. So you belong to... you don't belong to the Scandinavian Fraternity? No. No? No, I had enough to belong to. So this is Thora Lodge. How many members are you now then? I hate to tell you. We're only about ten. That's all there's left? We were 80-something. But it seems most of them passed away. There's only ten left? Mm. So you've been the president then for... Supposed to be. You're running out of time. End of interview.
