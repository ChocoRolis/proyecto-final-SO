 Sveabok was born 1905, 2nd of January in Nesjø, Sweden. He came to the United States. 1923. And we have 15th of August, 1987. A show in Sweden. 1923. An exhibition. But you came to Kungsholm? Yes, it was borrowed from Halland. A sailor from Halland who took over the boat. Shall we speak Swedish? Yes. It's just as well. You were born in Nesjö. Yes. Your mother is from Boavfall. It's a small village outside of Nesjö. Outside of Nesjö, yes. And your father came from Längervägen. How did it come that he came to Nesjö? He was a tailor who sold fabrics. He was with a Jew and sold fabrics. They called it a tailor in the world. You know, the one who knitted around the country. And he met my mother. Her parents went to sell fabrics. He met her in her home? Yes. Out on the country. They drove around the country and sold their goods. They had books. Books too? They had books with fabrics. All kinds of fabrics. They had books with them. They didn't have the fabrics, but they had samples. Just like this catalog. But there were real fabrics in the books. So there were long ones. They took orders. That's what they did. There was a Jew with him too. He became acquainted with him in Nesjö. So he wanted to go with a Jew. You know, the Jews are... You know, I can't speak about it. They are good sellers. Yes. So he was with my father. My father sold for a factory. When that factory went up, I don't know how many workers there were. What is it? They called it... No, in Nesjö they called it the clothing factory. That's where they sold the fabrics. So my father worked there. He was a guard at the factory. So that factory went up and they sold fabrics and clothes. So they ordered clothes from the factory. Costumes. A cap and a jacket. And then my father died. But he was there for many years. He died in 1920. My father died. But the factory was still there. But they were at home. So your father worked all his life. So you lived in the city. Yes. And you were eight children. We had a farm too. You did? Yes. My mother and my brothers helped with the farm. But that went out later in the years because my mother was too old. She worked for the state in Nesjö. So you lived on the outskirts of Nesjö. Yes. Because I'm in the city now. Were you one of the younger or older children? I was younger. So all of us were next. What kind of work did the boys do? There were five boys. When my father was alive, he took care of the farm. After we were gone from Nesjö, the state came and did the work for the city. My brother Carl... What did he do? I can't remember what they did. But they stayed in the farm? Yes. None of them thought about... My brother came here with me. But he died. What was the reason for you being infected with the flu? We had a friend from America. She took me here. You went with her? Yes. She said, if you want to come here, I'll take care of you. So we came to them. They were called Mattson. They were Swedish. She was a neighbor to us. She had just married a Swedish-American. When she came home, she promised to come here. So we came here. She guaranteed for you and your brother? What was your brother's name? His name was Harold. Harold Anderson. Did she send you money? Yes, we paid for it ourselves. What did you do in 1923? I didn't work at all. I served in the park. And at the same time. And you helped your mother at home? Yes. I was a housewife. What did your brother do? He worked with cars. Where was he? Hudson's? I think he worked at Hudson's. But it didn't last long. He worked here and there. I mean in Sweden. He worked at a jewelry store. Did he have a license? No, but he promised to come here. It wasn't hard to come here in 1923. Many people came. Did you have to wait long before you got the papers? Yes. Did you buy the tickets in Järsjö? Yes. And then to Gothenburg? Yes. And then to Kungsholm? Yes. An old boat from Malmö. And the trip was good? Yes. How was it on Ellis Island? It was good. Was it hard to get here? No. When we got to Ellis Island, we called our friends. They met us at the train station. So you lived in New York? Yes. And you came to New York to get the tickets? Yes. We got a ticket to get to the train station. So no one met you in New York? No. You were alone? How did it go? Neither your brother Harald nor you could speak English? No, but we had one on the boat who could speak English. He had tried to learn a little English, but he took care of everything. So we had him to help us. How did you get by without ordering food and coffee? We didn't need anything like that. The train went from New York to Buffalo. And that's where we took the train. And then we came from Buffalo to Detroit. Are you from Canada? Yes. But you had to eat on the train? Yes, we got a snack and something to eat. We sold on the train, but we weren't on the train for that long. They didn't take us. I get mixed up with this. So you came to Detroit and met the Madsons. You were already here in Detroit. Did you get a place to live? Yes, we went home with them. And you lived with them? Yes, I had a job before I came here. So she had a job? She had a place before she went to Sweden. She had quit her job because she married this Swedish American. And I took over her job. In a home for a doctor. An American? Yes, a doctor-American. We went to the church and there was a priest who spoke Swedish. He taught us a little Swedish. In English? Yes, in English. Was that in the Lutheran church? Yes. In Manor? In Manor, but it wasn't there. It was a small church that the Swedes had. From Benetou. How did it go to be an employee with an American and not know English? Okay. Okay, but it wasn't easy when he wanted to cook food and all that. She taught me. Did she? Yes, she taught me. And there were other measures and all sorts of things. Did you bake too? No. No baking? No. Americans don't bake that much. They don't? No. How was it to bake, or rather to cook American food? It wasn't hard. She helped me so much with the food. She did? Yes. I ate with them too. At the same table? Yes. So it wasn't strict? No. She had this girl who got married, who was from Nefjö. She had worked there for a long time, so it went pretty well, because she was Swedish. And did you live with your family there? Yes. What kind of work did your brother Harald get? He worked at a mobile factory, but it went bankrupt. It did? Yes. He made all kinds of things. He made walls, he made tiles, he made blocks. I don't know, he did everything. I don't know. It was so big. And then you went to some Swedish associations in Detroit? Yes, we went to the Danish club. We had a dance club on 12th Street, a Green River. I met my husband there. And he had been on the same boat as you? Yes, but he was in the second class. So he was a bit more... He was....a more refined company. He was the one who went further down. He had more money than we did. But he came to a Swedish family too, but that was before that. We'll talk to him about that later. Did you go to the Danish club? No. You were just there dancing? We were just there dancing, and I met him on a New Year's Eve. I had another girl with me. We met all kinds of people. And the Swedes went to the Danish club? Yes, all kinds of Swedes from all over came there. One came from Ohio. Where was the Swedish club? On 12th Street, a Green River. Is that downtown? Yes, but now it's just black. So that was the dance pavilion? So the Swedes didn't have a dance pavilion? No, there were more Danish and Norwegian than Swedish. I think they borrowed......from each other. And the Finns were there too? Yes. The Finnish club was not far from here. So they had their own club? Yes, they had their own club. But the Swedes and the Norwegians got to rent a dance pavilion? Yes, the Danes. How long did you stay with the doctor? I didn't stay long. Then I got a job at another family. But they didn't pay me much, so I got another job. And more money. Then I stayed there for a while. And I got a job at a motor company. I was in the oxygen room. They were cleaning all kinds of things for the cars. Car cleaning. What did you call it? Car cleaning. For chairs and... And for the roof. And the roof too. We were five or six girls. We were Swedish. And that paid better than being in a family? Oh yes. How much did you have an hour? An hour? 25 cents an hour. It was a lot of money at that time. No short-time work? Yes, we had that too. But you had more money at the end of the day when you worked with... Yes, a family. So you took care of it yourself. Yes, so a girl, another girl, we lived together. We rented a room and a kitchen. So it went well, you shared the costs. And you could save money too. So how did you go during the depression? Did you save money and put it in the bank? We didn't earn as much as we could. No? No. So we got married. I was with my husband for a year and a half. What year did you get married? 1925. 1925? So you... We got married in 1962. And then you stopped working at the packing factory? No, I worked there after we got married. I worked there after we got married. And a year later......we bought furniture and moved to an apartment. And then... What did we do then? He worked at... I don't remember... We got a job at Edison's. The place we lived in before we had an apartment. So he got a job there. The one who rented it to us. The owner of the house. He helped him move to Detroit Edison. So he worked there for 42 years. And it was steady work that......gave you a livelihood. Yes. How long did you work at the packing factory? At the owner's? Two years, I think. And then you stayed at home? Yes, I stayed at home after we got an apartment. I worked a little bit. I went back to the factory. I had stopped for a while. And then I went back to work again. For a year. Were there many Swedish girls who came to you in the early 20's? Yes. And they got housework? Yes. Most of them? Yes. And they worked for a few years and then got married? I had friends who worked for the Fisher Brothers. Fisher? Fisher. Fisher, yes. They had... I don't know how many Swedish girls they had. Five or six. They had a shipowner. And a maid. A housewife. I had a friend who worked for Mrs. Fisher. She made all the clothes for her. She laid them out and pressed them. And for him too. And for the children. And that was all she did? Yes. She worked there for a while and then got married. She married a man called Afrgaat Husnaim. And they... She is from Sweden and she lives in Sweden. She moved to Sweden? Yes. But we have friends in California. There is a man up here called Carl Jansson. He has relatives in California. And he knows them. So they worked for Fisher? Yes. They had all the Swedish people who worked for them. Only Swedish? One was German. His uncle, Carl Jansson's uncle. They worked for Fisher for a long time. They worked there when I was there too. And served. I helped them serve. Sometimes. And they had their... Oh, they had... Their house was somewhere? Oh no, they had a beautiful place up in Palme Woods. Palme Woods? Yes, just like Gosbont. You know, there was a big shot who worked there. He lived there. So it was on the north east side of Detroit where they lived? For Nema? It was for Nema's people at that time? Yes, many Swedes worked in Gosbont at that time. But Palme Woods was where I worked. So no workers lived up there? No, not that. Not regular work. It was big houses. Yes, big houses. So the Greddans of Detroit lived there? Yes, the Greddans of Detroit lived up there. There were probably only fish on it, right? No, not much. Well, you know, they... I mean factories. Kärlak, Kärlak. They had cars called... What was it? What did they call the cars? What they did. Chevrolet, Buick. They made all the cars? Yes. It's so hard to... So he could handle the fish? Yes. And there were two brothers? No, there were five. Five? And they were all in the same... Yes. I had a mother who lived there. She had a house there on the same street. But they had so much party. Did you visit your friends sometimes? Yes. Oh yes. You were in his house, the fish house. Oh yes. Were they good workers, they said? Oh yes, they were nice people. They were nice to work for. They weren't Jews? I don't know what they were. I think they were German and such. What do you think they were? But do you know who they were? Yes, they worked there for a long time. When they went... She, with her fish, she used to go to France so much. She gave my friend so much nice things when she came back. Presents? Yes. Did they pay well? Yes, they paid well. At that time, most of the people who had worked there didn't pay much. So it was unusual to have them there? Unusual. Those who were big, you know, who had nice houses, happy grandchildren. I had a friend who worked in a farmhouse near Daz. They paid well too. A Ford. I knew Henry Ford when he was a little boy. I see. I had a friend who worked there. Was it the old Ford? The old Ford. No, Henry Ford, the youngest. He was the youngest. Henry Ford was the next one. How many boys did they have? Three? Henry, Edsel... And Clee. Clee, yes. So you saw the old Henry Ford? No, I saw the young Ford. The young ones? Yes. Henry when he was young. So they didn't mind that your friends got a visit? No. No, not physically either. They had a dining room for themselves. They served and we could sit there and eat. I see. And they were nice. So they were happy that they got a place? Yes. How did they get these places? Well, because, you know, maybe someone who had Swedish... I don't know how it went, but maybe someone was Swedish and they asked if there were more people. At that time there were so many Swedish Jews, so they got a place with the same. But they were good people. Yes. So they recognized what they called it. So they were accommodated? Yes. It was hard to get. You should have known that you had come so you could write. How did they live? Yes, one day a week. Was it Thursday? Thursday and Wednesday. And Wednesday. Wednesday or Thursday. So they always worked on Saturday and Sunday? Yes, but they also got off in the afternoon. What did they think of you? They liked it. They did? Yes. But there was no rest, it was only on Thursday when everyone else worked. Yes, most of the people who had help, they got off on Thursday. And they met? Yes, we met and went down to the city. We went to a cinema or a place where there was music. Did they dance a lot in the week? No. On Saturday evening they had a dance in Danska Halen. But most of them worked? No, they didn't work in the evening. So they were off in the evening? Yes. When you think back, it's so sad when you don't know that you had come so you could write. You have a lot to tell about that time. Yes, I have a lot to tell. They bought this place in 1925. Do you remember? Yes, I remember. We came here before they bought it. We heard that they were going to buy a place in the country and do just like they did in Sweden. Summer cottages? Summer cottages. So they built small houses. So you could just hang your hat, as they said. But we came here almost every Saturday evening. Or we camped out here and set up a tent. We did that first. Didn't you think it was far to go from Detroit? Yes, it was. It was the furthest away. We had a Ford. What was it called? We bought that Ford. T-Ford? Yes. What was it called? Was it a T? What? Was it a T Ford we had first? Yes. And then it took all day to get up there. But you came here on Saturday and stayed the day? Yes, we camped out here. And it was a wild area up here? There were no houses? There was no bridge here either. How did you get over here? The guys helped us. When we first found out that we were going to buy this place, the farmer had a wife here. He was German. His name was Bran, the farmer. We went to Jitsja. When we camped out here, the cows got to sleep. We were here on Saturday and Sunday. We went on Friday evening and were here on Saturday and Sunday. And we went home on Sunday afternoon. Did you stay here all summer? For many years. And did you have tents? Yes, most of them had tents. Did you bring the tents home during the week? Yes, we brought them home. But you had bought this area? No, we hadn't bought it until September. We came here in the summer, in June, up here to camp. In September 1925, we bought this place. So you were here to... We met them... We have a girl up here. She's not... She's been married. She has two kids. We met her mother and father. They were with me in... What do you call it? Von der Lade. At the Vasa Lodge? Yes. But they had nothing to do up here in Vasa, in Detroit? No. They were completely free? No. This is page two. It continues with Svea Buck in La Perle, Michigan. Page two. And the 5th of August, 1987. So, the Vasa Lodge in Detroit. There were members from there. From there, yes. But they had nothing to do with the organization? No, they did in some... Because most of the Vasa members were in... Bought places up here first. But you had, you know... Vasa members, we didn't belong to Vasa members. We belonged to the Nord. There's another lodge. And you didn't belong to Framden? No, we didn't. We didn't buy it at that time. We bought, oh, about 30 years ago, we bought that lot here. See, when you buy a lot, you can build on it, on 75 by 75. First, they only had 75 by 35. But they had to change it because there was not much room. See, we don't have much room in the back. No, we got more in the front. But you got a big house there. Yeah, but that's... they give you the lot and you got to be... 75 by... 75 by 75. Then you got to have 15 feet from your next door neighbor. And the next door neighbor have to be 15 feet from you. See, and that's... and what is it, 25? From the road. To the house. Who figured out the stuff for you? Well... The lawyers and the... Well, we had a lawyer, Nelson. He was, you know, he belonged to the lodge. He was into it, too. But he didn't have nothing, you know. But he was the one that helped them out. So, you know, so we started, you know, with our house, we started to build 1950... What was it, 1958? We started to build. We bought it in 57 and 58 we started to build. And the next door, the same thing. He started it and we built mostly everything ourselves, except outside. We have a basement underneath, too. But when you first came out here, that was in the 1920s, in the late 20s, right? 25. 25. 25 in the fall. No, 25, 26, I think, that was in the fall. So then during the Depression and all the way through the Second World War and up to the 50s, you went out here just for... Camping. For camping. There was no houses built there. No. They started down at the... All the men, there's more now, they started down in the woods as a basset club. They started with that first. Then they started to build a pavilion so people could come up here so they could pay for the place. So they had dances. Yeah. And dances and they had food to eat. They sold food. They cooked outside here. They had a cook so... So you could bring in a lot of people from Detroit and do dances here. Yeah. So they went here and then instead through Danish Hall. Yeah. Well, Danish Hall was not much in summertime. Mostly in wintertime. Only in the wintertime. Yeah. So, you know, we came up here, you know, and stayed overnight. So how many were up here, you think, during the Depression, for instance? Was it less people then or more? I think there were more people. There was nobody living here all summer? No, no. I think there was, just before we came up, Pete Benson built in 1948, he built his place. But that was a small place. When we started to build, you know, we wanted to build one so we could retire here. So you had the big size immediately from the beginning? Yeah, you had to have a drawing on it. And then, you know... But you haven't made it bigger then? No. This is the size you had. That's the size we had. There was intention to never improve it. Because we had a lawyer, and Louis Vaughan, you know, she was so against people coming up because she thought taxes was going to be higher. But didn't they want people to come up a lot? To people the place? Yeah, they started to build small places. Mostly everyone now. That house over there was a small house. You know? Yes. Yes, that was just one floor. And he was a carpenter, I think, and he was helping them building, Mr. Engblom. And he was helping... I think it was next to Florence Johnson, and next to Pete Benson, you know. And he was the first one, I think, Willie Hanson, next to Florence Johnson, where you talked to on the telephone. You say you talked to her. Well, his place was small. And he had two rooms, I think, a bedroom and a big front room, and a kitchen. And the bedroom, there was no bedroom there, you know, years back. But we built a bedroom and everything when we started. So, you know, they had a toilet outside, down here in the front of that big house, and a tennis court. It was the old primitive style, outhouses. You didn't have a septic tank at that time, though? No. Nobody had it. We had it when we built. You were one of the first houses then? No, I think it was... I think Benson's had one, but it was too small. Did they have one? Benson's? Yeah, it was small. I don't know if they had one or not. I don't think so. You know. But when we came up, you know, the law changed, and you had to have septic tanks. So we put one in. And then, after a few years, we moved to Sweden in 1968, and then we built... You know, we had to put in another... More room you had. They go after the rooms. Then you had to have a bigger tank. So we put in a 1250. And... So when you look back now, how has it worked out then? Oh, my. Everybody, everybody, I tell you, built bigger houses. Next door, he built up his house, second floor. That house was small. He built up his bedroom upstairs. Them over there, Mr. Roosters, they built two bedrooms. And Carl Johnson, he built... I guess he got one big bedroom and one small bedroom up there. But he got a basement, too. Not too many that had a basement at that time. And across the street there, you know, he's Swedish, but I don't think she is Swedish. And he built upstairs, Mr. Wahlström, across the street. Why did you need a second floor? Did you have the children with you here? Did you have your daughter with you? No. We had our daughter. They came up on weekends. Oh, for the visitors, then. But they have a place up there because his parents had a car, this upper. And they built it very small, you know. The bedroom was so small, you know, you could just get in and not much to hang your clothes. So they had two... They had two bedrooms, and there was no... There was a toilet there. And they put the tank in that when they came up. So they took over after they died, you know. And they built a bigger house. So there's a big house up there, like Doris Spencer. There was a small house up there, too, and she built two of them for that house because her daddy built that house. And now the law was that they could only be Swedes? There was... One of us had to be Swedish. You had to be a Swedish, you said? Uh-huh. Yeah. And they've been kept all the way through? Yeah. There is no way for an outsider to come in then, too? No. And how about if you want to sell them if there are no Swedes there? They got to be Swedish. They got to be Swedish? Yeah. And it worked out fine then. You've been all Swedish, you all knew each other, and no... Yeah. No fighting or anything like that? Oh, there'd been a lot of fighting. Jealousy and fighting. Yeah, but you're all the same breed, so to speak, and we usually understand each other. Yeah, but, you know, now, like, all those people, you know, that came up years back, they was young, and now they're taking over, the young people taking over. See, our daughter and her husband, you know, he was Fin... she was Finnish and he was Swedish. Oh, her husband? Your daughter's husband? Yeah, he's a Swede Finn. Oh, okay, so they are interested to live up here, too, then? Yeah, they live here. There was our daughter. So she lives also here? They live up there. Next door... across... you know, next street, Doris Varn lives. Is she the one you went to first? Yes, well, I saw her first, yes. Yeah? And how about... Do most of the children of people living here coming up here to live, to follow in their parents' footsteps? Mm-hmm. They do. They do? Yeah. Most of the children of the... Yeah, yeah, of the parents. They come back and live here? Yeah. Do they retire here, too, like the parents? They will, because we get some down there below Doris and they built big house... You see a new house down there? Yes, and this is... He's going to come up and live. This is the second generation? Yeah, this is the second generation. Oh, so you have no problem, then, for young people coming up? No, no, and I don't know, I suppose he's... Next door go to his kids. And if you don't, you sell it to somebody there, one Swede. But there should be Scandinavian, I think. Should sell it to anybody that's Scandinavian. But they don't want to call the people. They don't want to call the people. But how about Scandinavian... I mean Norwegians, now? We get them mixed, too. We get them mixed up with Swedes here, too. They got to be some Swedes, too? Yeah, uh-huh. Got to be one Swede. So then you have your own council here, on board of directors, and you take care of yourself? Yeah. You don't have any security people or police here? Do they guard... No, but, you know, we get security from Lepia. Lepia. That's the only thing we get, is security, if you call it. You have your own water. We got our own water, and electricity. Electricity we get from Edison's. But years back, they didn't have it. They had a generator there to make electricity, first. That's what they had? Yeah. How did that work? There was problems out there. Fine. But it worked? Fine. Because the man that done it, he know how to operate it. So that worked fine, you know, for years they had it. That took long time before they got paid for, you know, what they got paid for. They bought it from Farmer Brown, and all the property here, you see where you come in, and all around here, except on that side of the club, that fellow down by the lake, he's a wealthy man, and he bought that property next to us. Wow. So how many acres? 365 acres here. 365 acres. And we rent the farm out. Oh, you rent the farm out? No, the club. The club rents it out? Mm-hmm. And he is German, and he's German and Indian, I think he is, and she is American. So his wife is not Swedish. She's French and Indian, I think she is. You have to pay property taxes here, then? Oh, yes, we pay taxes. You do? You pay to the county? Yeah. We pay it to the city of Lefebvre, don't we? We pay all the taxes, school taxes and everything. You live in Elba County? Elba County. Mm-hmm. Can't touch it. Mm-hmm. Yeah. So there's been pretty good living down here. Yeah, that's quite a nice. How long have you been here then? We've been here 20 years now. Permanently? Yeah. That'll be next month, September, when I retire. What do you do now in the wintertime when you are snowed in here? No, we got, we got, we have a fellow, you know, and he plows the road for us. But he is an outsider. So he plows the streets then? Yeah, all the streets. We don't have no trouble to get out. And the fire? Fire we have. Protection? Well, you know, we got that from Lefebvre. Lefebvre. Yeah. So you have your own little settlement in here? Yeah, uh-huh. Everything is our own. So how many houses are located here then? God, I don't know. I remember how many there is. Fifty? Quite, there's about 50 houses, I think. Maybe more. Think there are 50 houses? You think there are more than 50 houses? No, I don't think so. No? I haven't counted the houses. And how about the big hall now? Is that used during the summer again? No. Yeah, that's used about three times a year. Oh, for picnics and programs? Yeah, for picnic and closing up party. And after we close up, everything goes in, all the benches and tables and stuff, they put in on the pavilion. And they take the pipe from the toilets, you know, out from the lake. We got a spring-fed lake. And we can't have no motors. No water work? No. Because they cannot have water. And people down there and the kids swimming there all the time. So there's a good lake for swimming? Yeah. That's a good property here. So then you are getting a lot of visitors from Detroit? Yeah, at the picnic. Can they come up? Oh my goodness, yeah, a full gang are coming up here. I think about over 400 people here for July. And they close them up, closing up party, you know. They have dinners this year for the closing up, and they have their catering to us. You know, we have them coming to our club here, to the clubhouse, I mean to the pavilion, and they catering the food. And they cut the meat for the dinners. So there's no potluck or anything like that? No, no. Everybody takes it easy and getting served? Well, you know, they have a table set, so you get served that way. You don't have to go and help yourself. But at the picnic, you know, we have certain people here, you know. All the people that hasn't been here as long as us, they have to walk. See, we are retired from all the walk now. After 30, after, see we walked for, for, 28 years I walked on the kids. 28 years? 28 years, yeah. And I made pancake in the morning. I took care of the kids. So we have that settled, you know. Somebody have to take care of different hours. So you have turned a lot of Swedish pancakes? Oh, yeah. Isabel Benson, too. I see. A lot of them have to help. So when do they? I made them up, I made them up so they can take the dough and fry them. And somebody, you know, have to bake the bacon. So we have a gang, you know. We have so many at one, you know, so many hours before us. When do they decide now for you to retire from a job like that? We got, you know, a book. 30 years, you said? No, if you, how many years you're supposed to work? 25? That depends how old you are. Oh, I see. So you have put your years in then? Yeah, I put 28 years in. 28 years in. And then you can... Retire. You are like a guest then? Yeah. So the next generation, now they took over after you, do they make as good pancakes as you did? I don't know. Some people say yes and some people say no. There comes a different opinion. He is the president next to us. Jakobsson is the president. And he said, you never had a better pancake than I made. And I used to pickle herring for them too for the picnics. And one fellow from Flint, he said to me, he said, that's the best herring I had in 40 years. So I must have good herring. So we pickled herring, you know, for the picnics too. And we have Knäckebröd and Swedish Slumpa. We get that, I guess, from Detroit. But do the young generation do it the same way as you did it though? Sometimes. Like your daughter now, is she on the committee to serve and cook? Yeah, she done her duty for July. She worked for four hours. Oh, she did? Yeah. So she is trained by you then, not to flip the pancakes? No, she don't bake pancakes. No, who is doing it? I don't know what she's in with. I think she's in the evening with sandwiches and stuff. Oh, I see. See, we had different, you know, ours for the picnic, we have Dines. And first we got breakfast, then we got Dines. And then in the afternoon they have sloppy joe's, whatever they want for sandwiches, you know. And pickled herring, stuff like that all evening. And hot dog and stuff. So sloppy joe's I understand anybody can continue on, I mean, or take over. Yeah. But like Swedish pancakes now and herring. And meatballs. That's another dish. Will the next generation be able to do it the same way with the same process? Well, some of them are trained for that. They do it pretty good. Yeah, because we got some people from Flint across there, and she'd make good pancakes. We got a club in Flint too, you know, a Swedish club. And we, for closing our party last year, we had all Swedish smorgasbord. And they were making it, the young people. And they made it good. They made it good. So you think it will continue in another few years? Yeah. But there was a lot of work for the girls. But we used to have a lady, it comes from Pete Benson, but she passed away. And she used to make Swedish smorgasbord. I don't know how many years she took over and made that. And that was the first people we met that, you know, started that club. Her daughter lives across the street now, from Pete Benson. But she's not up for her. She lives at the Danish retirement club up in Rochester. Is there a big Danish group here too in Detroit? Not as big as the Swedish though. I don't know. The Danish is pretty big. Pretty big? Yeah. Yeah, they got two clubs in Detroit. And they serve very good food. One in Grand River, I know that. And one, oh, is that one we went to? Daddy? Is that one in Grand River, they got that one? That big one we went to? Grand River and 12th Street. Yeah. No. That's not in Detroit. That's outskirt of Detroit, isn't it? That 12th Street, they closed up a long time ago, that Danish place. But they got a new Danish club. So the old Swedish neighborhood now, where they were mostly Swedes, were they around the Immanuel Lutheran Church? A lot of them was. Quite a few of them. Yeah. And that area has changed completely now? Yeah. So then the people moved out to the suburbs? Well, they moved out to the suburbs, and some of them still belong to the Swedish church. We had another, out in St. Clair Shores, we had another minister, and his name was Ekeberg. But he went away to Boston, I think. A lot of people went there, too, because they cannot be called. But we got some called people, because the lady, the pastor's wife passed away last week at the Immanuel Lutheran Church. Oh, Pastor Thurid? Yeah. And we went there for the funeral. And the hall was full. You know, we have a big... Have you been there? Yes. And the hall was packed with people, for nice people. Pastor Thurid is a nice fellow. That's the best. The best we had. But you're not able to go to church services all the time regularly? No, no. That's too far. So how do you do it then? Well, if you want to go up here, we got the Jörmund Lutheran. We got Jörmund Lutheran Church up here. Is that about the same as the... Something like it, yeah. But never any good speakers like Pastor Thurid. We never had any better speaker than Pastor Thurid. So he's good. We liked him very well. He's been there quite a few years now. Yeah. But Susan been married 30 years. 32 years Susan been married, and he had her wedding. And Mrs. Thurid was crippled up. She had arthritis, and then she got cancer. So she died from both. So we just buried her last week. So we went down, Susan and I. We can't go. So you're falling away, the old times. We are not, we are not more than about five, six left of the old people here. They go fast after you get... When you get 50, time go too fast. But we worked hard. There was, here was just like a jungle. And I cleaned it. He went home and went to work. And I was up here, and I cleaned it up. The whole club up, because the street was always that high. And Els brother and daddy had a lot there for one of the sons. But he didn't want to come up. I bet there was a lot of mosquitoes there at first. Oh my, and how. We still got mosquitoes, but that's you been too dry. You know, from the creek. See, we got a creek that goes around. Yeah, and it gets so wet down below here, like a swamp. So there you get a lot of mosquitoes. Yeah, we got a lot of mosquitoes. But you just spray, years back, first when we came up, you just spray that, was it DDT? Yeah. Yeah, then it was good. But afterward, more than, you know, that's awful. Yeah, that's a lot of swampy area here. We have a lot of swampy area all around. But that's nice. It's a nice area. Yeah. Does this remind you of Osmola? Somewhat. Because a lot of students. Gronskogen, I thought. Yes. You know, there were nurseries, years back. Is that it, Ann? Nurseries. There were nurseries, years back. They were selling out. And they bought all those fir trees, what we have here. They bought it and planted it down here. You know, when we first came up, there were no fir trees. Here you got a good one out here. It looks like a Christmas tree. Yeah. So we planted a lot of it by the road. Have you missed your area home in Småland over the years when you've been here? I mean, the nature? No, I don't think so. You get used to it. You get used to it. Yeah. But coming off of Nesjö, it was not very big, you know, when you left 1953. No, no. And you came to the big Detroit. Yeah. It was a lot of noise. I didn't like it. You didn't? No. Too much noise? Yeah, too much noise. Yeah, too much noise. Yeah, but that was at that time. Sure. In 2010. You know, we had an electric park right by the Detroit River, you know, where you go over to Canada. Yes. And there was a lot of noise. Oh, my goodness. We had a noise in a restaurant where I walked, you know, when we was walking to Pekis, we used to go into. And when I saw people there, I didn't want to eat the food. And the people I walked for, you know, the last time, they was Stearns. You know, they had perfume and powder and stuff, a factory down at Jefferson. And they had one in France. And I walked for those people. And they had a colored girl and colored man. He was a chauffeur and she was a maid. And they used to send on food, cake and stuff. I wouldn't eat it. Because they were colored. Where do you get the idea? I don't know, from home. They didn't know anything about colored people in Sweden, though. Sure they did. They did? Oh, sure. They used to come in with the circus and stuff. Oh, yeah, that's the only way. Yeah. And I took them where my sister lived, and, you know, we met a colored fellow there. He came up to us, and he was going to call the police. He got scared. He came off from the boats. Now you know. So you saw plenty of them? Oh, my. You know, down at the Lactis Park, there was just full of them. You know what I mean, Lactis Park? Yeah, I know a little bit. You know, the roller coaster and stuff like that. Oh, there were a lot of them down there. And I thought, my goodness, that if they come to town, all those niggas is... Did the Swedes keep, kept together years ago? I mean, they all ganged together, the Swedes? Here? Yeah, in Detroit? That seems like it. They did? Yes. It seems like they did. They belonged to different groups? Yeah. Uh-huh. We went to the shoes, and they kept together, and we went to the Denis Hall, and they kept together. We had good times years back. I think we had a better time than the young people have now. We were not afraid to go out and camp or nothing. We used to go and camp here and there, you know, and stay for weeks. We were not scared. But they're different now. Did you hear about those two girls that went from Sweden up to California? Yes. They were killed. They never found them. Benson's granddaughter went and—
