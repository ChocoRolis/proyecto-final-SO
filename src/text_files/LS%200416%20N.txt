 This is tape number three, page number one. We continue our interview with Joel and Mrs. Jernberg in Rackford, Illinois. Today is July 15, 1986. Tape number three, page one. If I now ask you a question, if you look back at the 1930s and the Depression, was there not an opportunity for you, Joel, to go to Chicago and tell the state authority that you wanted to borrow 50 or 100,000 dollars to start the factories again? You had 40 or 50 workers waiting outside. Roosevelt came in on 1933. President Roosevelt. President Roosevelt. Yeah. What did he do now? Was that good for your business? He's the one that set up Social Security. The New Deal. Was that New Deal good for your business, for instance? Why, sure. It helped everybody. It helped everybody. It was good for the worker and good also for the management. Yeah, but I'll tell you something. And you had no unions at that time, in your shop, for instance? Anybody could work in your shop, no union. Oh, we had a union. You had a union? Sure. He wasn't approved, but they had... They kicked the guy out. He'd come in there during the day. I told him, get outside. You ain't taking up the man's time and money here. Our money. So he came right into the shop? Yeah. Sure. During working hours? Sure. Then they had one article and they were ready to sign the damn things. We had a meeting. It says, seniority shall prevail. And the boys, they were all six, seven companies. And they were ready to sign that. That's dynamite. And to do that, seniority in accord with his ability. That's the way it was going to be. And we did, too. So they had their own union, then, your workers? Ah, sure. They didn't belong to a big national one, then? No. They were going to snow us one night. We had a meeting at the... That was the Foss Hotel. And... Action was supposed to take over that night. And a nice fellow, a good church member and everything else, was Exterim Carlson Company. And when he came to me five minutes before the meeting was to start, and he shook all over, he said, I'm sorry, sir, but I can't. I'm sorry, sir, but I can't. Will you take over? So I know what the issues are. And all the union members, they were over to SM and SF Lodge. What kind of lodge is that? Huh? SMOS? Is that... Oh, I see. There's a bar. There's a club, really. Yeah. Sung Ferening is one. Or down there in the downtown... Oh, it was... Seminary. No, it was on Second Avenue. Second Avenue. Seminary. Anyhow, I see how you feel, either. I'll take over, I said. So I went up to the desk. So I... I says, this is it. I said, the guy in charge of the union. Yes, he said. And this is it. Yeah. If you don't agree to both of those items, you're done. You put your foot down? Yeah. Another one that put his foot down was Hillman. And I got one notice, a letter, from the union that wasn't affiliated with the AFL. And the guy who ran away there, Carlson, he says, Say, did you get a notice from this organization? Yeah. Why'd you do that? I was fighting a wastebasket. I don't recognize it. If it was the AFL, they'd have strength. Forget it. I said, I'm going to strike. They were going to have against us, too. They couldn't afford to be without a job at that time. How about Swan Hillman, though, on Rockford Province? Swan Hillman. He was a tough guy. He was a good friend, a good friend of mine. Yeah, right. He also kept the union out, but they still paid good wages, though. No, he... How was he able to do that? He wasn't mean, but they had some mean fellows out there. Swan was all right. Because he had a big operation going on. You bet. Hundreds of workers. Yeah. I remember Swan, another guy walked from National Lockup, and the other walked from back up, and the oil was squeezing out of their shoes. Shoes. Oh. So they were tough, then. They were tough. Who were the ones that was tough now? Was it the Irish people or Italians or the Swedes? Or the workers now? Yeah. Which one were the toughest in negotiations, labor management? Like the Italians, Irish, or the Swedes? I... We had very few Italian mechanics. Very few. He wants to know which was the hardest to work with. Those that were, I honored them. We didn't know far. But some of them were no good. No, that's what I was thinking. But you being of Swedish background, you would think you would know the Swedish temperament and the Swedish behavior a little bit, but how about an Irishman coming in, you know, he is a toughie. Listen, the Irish used to settle on the west side. Yes. Before there was many colored down there, I'll tell you that. When I was a kid, I never saw it. But they met on Morgan Street Bridge, and you used to carry knives with them. That's right. Yeah, they did. I know. But the Swedes, they didn't back up, though, for instance. He was like your father, you know, he dropped a bundle of wood, you know, and took care of it. Yeah, damn right. So then, 1945, what happened then during the war? Then you had big production for the war. Yeah. Did you change over then from peacetime work to war material in your factory? Were you fabricating something for the government? Oh, God. Wait a minute. Yeah, they made work for the government, too. I quit. You got government orders, then? I quit business in 1952, I think. Yeah, but before, though, I mean, after the 1940s, you changed over to war production instead of peacetime production. Yeah. The washing machines had to wait. Yeah. What did you get in the war material? Oh, they were so doggone crooked here, I'll tell you. You know, I favored Japan. You did? Damn right. But you couldn't do the opening, though. Hey. It depends about who it was. Listen. Okay, I'll do it the first time. You had a time. Yeah, but you would think everybody was against them, you know, the bomb Pearl Harbor and everything. Well, what would you do if they cut off your lifeline? That was oil. It was oil. Yeah. Damn right. They didn't have oil over there. We had control of oil. So they started them out, then, from the... Capital of the oil industry was in the United States. So the Arabs, they were not known at that time. Yeah. Well, they were known, but not in the big business like they are over here. That's why they committed Harry Carrey. Yeah. That is. But you couldn't say that during that time, here in the United States. Hardly. Only to your wife, when you come home at night. Yep. You could read the news, you know, and say, this is all baloney. And then in 1945, you and a few others started the National Bank. 1945. How could you do that? I mean, you had enough capital then. And you saw a need for it, to have another bank. Yes, I did. And you became one of the trustees or the directors of the bank. Yeah. So you had made it pretty good then, up to that time, 1945. You were pretty good. His business was very good. How did he discuss business with you, now coming home from work after 14 hours workday, you know, and headaches? Well, sometimes he was too tired, he took a bath, went to bed. He never talked about business to you? Well, he did, yes. If anything went wrong, I knew it. And if it was bad, I knew that, too. What did you say then? I mean, could you cheer him up a little bit? No, I didn't either. The Rockheadian good said, go to bed. That's all I can... Yeah, but listen......member of that bank. Yeah. And the bank is still there. Yeah. I'm proud of him, I should say so. Are you still on the board of directors? No. No. No, he says, stay with it, he says. That's enough. I'm getting told... How long did you stay on then, on the board? Then... Well, you were on for quite a few years, weren't you, on the board? On the... On the bank? Yeah. I seem to remember every so often you were going to meetings and all that much. Oh. Yeah. So then you had control. Then you can borrow money. You didn't have to go to Chicago and beg for money or... I don't do that anymore. No, but I tell you... No, excuse me. And you were still running the Rockford Dying Tool? Yeah. Yeah. Was that the first thing you did? Yes. When did you sell or how did you retire from it? I sold out. Oh, you sold out. And you were still... Was it by the used cream? No. You were still companions then in this Rockford Tool and Dye? You were still two more? Yeah. It's colored all good. Oh. You mentioned earlier here, Joel, you saw your parents, the hardship they had on the farm. Your father died when you were 17, anyway, you were 14. 14. And mother, she moved into Rockford then at that time. Yeah, right. You left the farm. Yeah. And you told yourself you're not going to have it as hard as your parents had it because... You were going to bury yourself. And you did. Here you ended up now as a board of directors of one of the founders of National Bank in Rockford. You came to the top. One of the big businessmen in Rockford. In Rockford. Like Swan Hillman, P.A. Peterson, Faust and all the others. You betcha. I knew them all. You knew them all. Hallstrom was a good friend of mine. Mayor Hallstrom. Mayor Hallstrom, yeah, there's a Swede. He was a socialist, though. Was he a socialist, Hallstrom? Socialist? Yeah. Or was that Bloom? Yeah. Yeah, he was elected by the socialist ticket, though. Herman Hallstrom. I think he was. We should know because we were together all the time. Few families and Hallstrom's included. We'd have picnics and we'd have... They caught him in that parade. That's right. You paraded with him. They hauled him in. They saw him standing on the line, they hurried up and hauled him in. And then why they dubbed him a socialist? Something like that. But he was a mayor, though, for three terms. Oh, yeah, he was... That's the time the town was run the way it was supposed to be run, I can assure you. So he was a good mayor. He didn't care whether you liked him or not, but he did a good job. I'll tell you what he did. I met him in a restaurant. I'm trying to tell myself to listen. One day... We had trouble. After we had... We had a washroom. Okay, take it. In the shop. No. And there was pipe. We got the water from the street, 17th Avenue. I'll just show you how crooked it can get. Funny, I didn't guess it. You never could guess it. So we had a flash flood, I guess. That's right. Heavy flood. Oh, boy, deadly. Rain. Oh. It came into the building. I found the fault in the plumbing. It's hard to explain that. Oh, well, it doesn't matter. So they flooded. But anyhow... It got ruined. We had a boiler room down below, too, see? So we couldn't have that water down there. I traced it. And I found out that the doggone pump was running. I was there and it was perfectly quiet. But I heard a noise. And... Up in front, we had an area away coming into the shop like this, see? Around there, one side, on the east side. We had a bench there. And there was a good platform underneath that. I took the bench away. And here, that damn pump was running. Hey. So I got a job from a plumber. I had him come up and give me a price on it. I said, skip it. And I measured out the pipe and I had a guy put them in. I gave him all the dope for it and everything else. And told him I'll put it along the wall and in the top. And that went down in the basement. Now that saved us. Why did they do that? I'll tell you. They sent a guy down from a shop. That's... That's sand and clay down in there. And they'd have to crib that. See what I mean? With boards. Then lay the lines. And go to expenses they hadn't thought about. So I fixed that part. Then on the west side of the building, here we had trouble. There was a pipe that was leaking. A thin pipe. I never knew that they had a... They could make a pipe right hand thread on one side and left hand on the other? Huh? Never heard of that? They did. And I said, why the heck? You have got one pipe entirely like that. Why didn't you put a joint in between them? I never thought of that. It was faster work. They never got you to run for city council and straighten out the city. Like Herman Hallstrom. Why didn't he ask you to join him on the ticket there? I told him. Did you want more coffee? We didn't hear. So he was good. He was a beautiful man. And he was able to get elected to be a mayor three times by the Swedes. And the Irish voted on him. I think some of them stuck up, but they did too. Italians too? I don't know who did, but I know he won't never die. He knew what was going on. And the last time they wanted him to run, he said, this is it, I'm quitting. I served on the county board. You did? 11 years. How about the school board? You were not on the school board. I think he stayed out of that. The county board was better. Not at that time. City politics, that was better. But you were interested in politics though. You always been. Always been. Did you vote Democrat or Republican? Republican. All the way? The whole time? But? If I found a Democrat, that was a good, honest man. Oh, that was... Here in Rockford? Yeah. But not a national ticket though? No, no. No, that you couldn't do. How do you know now if he is honest? I mean in the national politics for instance. How do you know? How do you trust the newspapers? You see this question now with the Second World War with Japan and the United States? I don't know, brother. You didn't see that in the papers, you know, that anybody favored Japan? No. No. How did you get the idea? I mean, were you reading quite a bit? Yeah, we always read a lot. So you tried to think for yourself? I had... We had a gang down there at the old courthouse. And they... Well, I was chairman of the finance committee at first. And... Then I was chairman of the board of review two consecutive years. And nominated by... A democrat who had voted for me. I always sat up front because I had bad hearing. And... But there was one guy, Owen Pollard. Owen Pollard. Owen Pollard. Pollard, Pollard, whatever it is. And I think he'd gone to college, I heard that. He worked for Colonel Edison. Yeah. And he was a... Oh, some of the folks like... Representative for the Seward Townships. He was a nice guy. He told me once, Oh, all I know is cattle, he says, you know, to me. And he'd get up the podium and read a resolution. And he'd stutter, shiver a little, you know. Wasn't used to it and didn't like it for one day. And I'd never make a face when a man did that. Never. Oh, oh, oh. That idiot. I couldn't stomach the guy. And one day he was standing in the doorway there. And he says to him, You know, I... I was getting ready to oust you. I says, why didn't you? I never made it. Listen, the first time I run for office, Bob Leach, good friend of mine, who was with the water division, Springfield Avenue, he came over to my house here. And he wanted me to run for county board. I had done things for them. They used to make bricks out here and so on. And I helped them with that, the machinery there. And the sand loader and everything else. Everything worked out fine to me. So he had confidence in me. And... So I says to him, Listen, I ain't got time to campaign. I'm going to Florida in two days. This is Tuesday and then Thursday we start for Florida. I had a sister and brother-in-law living down in Orlando. We went down to see them. I won't have to campaign. You didn't either. I got the highest vote. By just staying awake. You were well known then. You were well known in Rockford. Well, they thought you were a good mechanic. He was very well known. And a good bank man. How can you lose? That's what I mean. I hired four men. Besides the three of us. At the common board. To go out and appraise property. And you did it yourself now. You didn't hire anybody instead of you to do it. You did it yourself? He was off with them. You were off? One of them was Merle. And he owns that tri-angle across from the post hotel. And he owns the pancake house. His father had plenty of money. Wealthy family. He was a nice guy. Very plain, nice guy. He had on a ragged coat. Winter time. He didn't care. And we'd go out and look at the property. And appraise them. And appraise them. For the county tax. And then we'd meet with the assessors. They had an office in the El Camo building. Across from the old courthouse there. They'd get papers about this high. And we'd spend the whole day with them. We'd catch guys cheating too, you know. One guy had a Cadillac. Classes. He was three or four years old. So I'd call the guy. And he went over to the cabinet there. And brought out the drawer. Showed the license plate. Issued by the state. The guy walked out with his head down. He had a pen. It's a tough job to keep to be an assessor. Nobody likes to have their taxes raised. They don't know what you said at all. How did they like you now after the first term there? Were you pleased with their approval? What happened? You gotta get this damn Jernberg off the board. They didn't until he quit by himself. The old courthouse. We had some dandies in the treasury department. I'll tell you. That old place, old brother. It was an interesting experience you had. It was interesting. It's hard to please everybody. You can't. But listen. They had a lot of money stashed away in the bank across the street. How about the big industrial owners in Rockford? When you came to SS there. The industrial owners in Rockford. Industry. The industry. How did you assess those? No. We never did. You never did? No. None that I know of. Who does that then? Because they also had to pay tax. Well. Like Sundstrand's Rockford Forge. Rockford Tool and Die for instance. How were they assessed? By whom? He should know that. Rockford Iron Tool. Who assessed Rockford Iron Tool then? Well you got the tax statement for heaven's sake. Harry West again. Well the government checks into that. Federal government. Oh you don't have any local guys doing that? No. Oh they come from the state? From Springfield? No. I see. They don't trust the local politicians about stuff like that? No. Not all of the time. Because it's too big then? Oh you know it. We got some of our politicians that are worth a dime a dozen too. And how, oh brother. They used to rave at old man Hallstrom, but believe me Hallstrom was stuck with guns and he didn't give a darn who he stepped on. We had Truman Johnson. Evans Anderson. These were the old bank up there. Security bank. Oh. On Broadway and 7th Street. And then we had, Paul Hogan was on the bank too. Paul was good. Yeah he was. I like Paul. Oh. Yeah. So there were quite a few Swedes then. Oh yeah, there was mixed in. In the politics of Rockford at that time, a lot of Swedes. Yeah. They had the upper hand, the Italians and the Irish. They were not in there at all. Not even from the West Side. Truman Johnson and Cookie Art Anderson. Cookie Art? How did he get that name? I went to school with him, Turner School. How did he get that name? Cookie Art. I don't know. I could never find that out myself. Cookie Art. He probably ate a lot of cookies. I said what a name to put on a guy. What any of them. But that's what they called him. And they stuck with him all his life. The interview continues next side. Side two of cassette three. Continuation with Joel and Esther Jenberg. Rockford, Illinois. Cassette three, side two. They were in bad shape. I understand they hired a railroad coach and went to Florida. Big time, huh? Yeah. Oh boy, they spent money like they had to. But they had a lot of money stashed away, covered by 20,000, I think, FDIC, Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation. So that was in later years then. It was in the 50s, then or 60s. Because you didn't get the insurance until after the war. FDIC. Yeah. Was it before the Second World War or was it after? When you started your bank, now national, was it you had an issue? That's under a national charter. A national charter. Yeah. You see, they had a state charter. Oh yeah, that's like they have out in Maryland, and they are not too healthy. Well, anyhow. So they went with the national and there was a four-sided cookie art team. He was this kind of a fellow. They go up to see Cookie. He had a lot of ego in him. Oh, he'd grant a loan to them. He thought it was good, you know, they'd pat him on the back. Oh yeah, he wanted to be a big shot. Yeah, some of them were church members. I knew them. They didn't live according to the Scripture. No. No, no. But... I guess not. So money is overriding even the Scripture. Now they all found short. We had one meeting with Truman Johnson, the banker. And that was our request. We tried to borrow some money. And he said... He wasn't so sure about it. He says, I'll give you a loan of $200 to me. And Dahlgren too. He was there at that meeting. And... So I... Oh, and he says to me, what's your stock worth today? And Art West, our... Bookkeeper. Our secretary. We gave him a couple of shares of stock. Nice fellow. And... Oh, Art says, $125 a share. Sell it for $50, that's all it's worth. And she said, that started a race. Yeah, he knew better. He went out, went through the gate, the swing gate, sat down at his desk. I says, how much is your bank stock worth today? Oh, I hit him right between the eyes, I tell you. Poor guy. Well... I saw them down at Stateville. Truman, Evans Anderson. And one more. Yeah, I know. Cookie Art was down there too. They called him. And I still... That's a terrible feeling. We had a... A judge. He was from Marengo. What was his name? I don't remember. Shurtlep. I call him Shurtlep. Shurtlep? Shurtlep? I call him Shurtlep. Shurtlep, his name is. Shurtlep? Yeah. I... Okay. Cookie Art. I was a character witness for him, before Judge Fisher. Now, Judge Fisher was half a drunk sometime. I was out to his house one time with a fellow. He was no good. But... I got a letter one day from Cookie Art's wife, who lived up on Rome Avenue. And... She said, I wish you'd have time to come up and see me for a few minutes. I got a letter from Judge Shurtlep. Fine, I'll do that. I drove right up there. And I saw this letter from Judge Shurtlep. It says, I never did think that Arthur was guilty of anything. But public opinion was against him. Can you imagine that? I didn't think it was anything wrong with him. So he fell on public opinion then? Yeah. Now I've seen a judge that needs correction. Yeah. Well, did he come back to Rockford again, this Cookie Art? Well, he came back. But then... I lived on Rockford Avenue. And I had Wally, Hank, and my brother Elmer living with me. I had gone to Sweden, so the men all went and they all lived at our house. But Elisabeth, Walfy's wife, and I went. That's what it was. And my little girl. I give her... So it was a sad story. Oh, it's bad. About a personal friend. Yeah, you bet. But what had happened here now over the years, the Swedish politicians in the 20s and 30s, and also in the 40s, their sons and daughters now that are living today, they don't seem to be interested in politics, because now you have Irish names, and McNamara, you have Italians. What happened to the Swedes? Don't forget Logan. Logan, that's another one, yeah. Listen. Is he Lithuanian? Here's something you can't answer, I can't either. There is no explanation for it. All cities grow east. East? Yes. What do you mean with that? They go eastward. They build up towards east. How come? Yeah. When you think about it, that's right. But the Swedes, they were on the east here. The Swedes, they were on the east now, but it seems to me that the west side is taking over the politics of Rockford. You are over on the west side now. You'll find all the places bordered up. No Swedes there? No. Nothing but Italians. But they are in the politics now, the Italians. They are in the politics of Rockford. How come did they come in? I mean, you know, the Swedes are still the largest segment. They voted them in. Now, that's why I can't figure out why didn't you have any Swedes running. Listen, on Marchesano Drive, you know where that is? No. FaceMaker started grocery store down there. They quit. They stole them blind. They stole them blind. They stole more than they bought. Stole the goods and everything else. There was a welfare store there. You can't cope with that. So finally they decided to pull out. They've just ruined the west side. What did? Fairgrounds. You should use Fairgrounds Park. No, Lord. You don't dare to go there. Oh, heck no. Stay out of there. You wouldn't dare walk. I wouldn't go beyond Avon Street at night. No. I don't think I'd go that far. They'd tip your car for you before you know it. Oh. But the northwest side now was a very affluent side. Northwest. All the big politicians and the industrialists that lived up there, of the Americans. Yeah, north end. North end. Is there still solvent or good? I think there are. Still big houses there? Auburn Avenue. It looks to me like they are. But you see a lot over there on the west side too. But the Swedes of the second and third generation, like your children and your same age, they are interested in politics though. Our daughter is more so. She is interested. Our son is not too bad either. But they don't seem to be involved with politics as you, for instance, now you were involved with. No, not like you. Frank, I was 90 years old. Last February. Sixth of February. And they had a big celebration for me here. Oh, yes, you noticed. And Frank St. Angelou would come out. He wouldn't come in. But he came out there. He stood outside and I talked to him. To see Joe. I said, I appreciate your presence. And he is the, who is he now? Frank St. Angelou. St. Angelou. Who is he? He is still with the county board I guess. The county board. So he was coming here to. He is a nice fellow, always was. He wanted him to come in but he wasn't going to get. He didn't really have time to come in. No. No, he was doomed but he wanted to stop. Oh, he made it a point to come on in. I knew his father, Jasper St. Angelou. I worked for a fellow. His name was Forsberg. And he wanted to build a new plant. So he bought some lots on 10th Avenue. And 10th Street. And it went right along the Illinois Central Railroad. That's right. And. So. I said to Fritz, Forsberg. He was the one that wanted to build. I'll go to bat for you. But listen, you can't contact these aldermen. You swear every other word. You don't know it but you swear every other word. He didn't even know it. He was a peach of a guy. He says, will you help me? Why certainly? Well, you mean the aldermen were more religious than. Well, you know, it wasn't really good. I went. You know, to swear about every third word. I went to see all the aldermen. He didn't even know it. The Swedes on this side. And met a couple of them in the X Club. So you did that for him then? Yeah, yeah. Sure. You were a lobbyist then, in other words. He was a very good friend of ours too. Now, who opposed this? Enford Erikson. The old man was a cop then. And he didn't want to. What did he have to do with that? Railroad going right by. Used to stop there, you know. Yeah. You could take the train. Come in, get off there. Then to go along. Downtown. So, I talked to the. Oh, I talked to Klein. You talked to all of them? Everybody about it. And we finally got it through. So you helped them? Jasper St. Angel and Blum. The mayor? The former mayor then. The former mayor. And I got to see, they agreed. That that should. So you were able to twist their arms, as they say? Yes, I did. They trusted him, really. So politics isn't a kind of lobbying, though. You need a lot of people to work for you. You got to talk to them before they vote. You cannot come in cold and say, this is what I want. It won't work. No, no, it won't work. You got to do a lot of groundwork before. And you knew how to do that. Just like the Toad and I. You got to do the groundwork right. Correct. So the cuts, what do you want to do? Something to stick. So then we went ahead with it. Now, listen, Hallstrom was? The mayor. The mayor. A very good friend. So they didn't know where the sewer was in the street. I drew up the plans. I drew them up myself. I'm no architect. You didn't have to be. You could draw up a machine drawing. You ought to be able to draw that up. I did it at night, drawing board at home. Unfortunately. And so that was it. So you presented this plan then for the city council? So, yeah, that's it. That's that one time, sewer trouble. Yeah, that's right. And he said, I'll check it. No, that was 17 down. The dugout sewer was 17 feet deep. They didn't want to quibble, you know. I told you that. That's that one. 17 feet deep. Yeah. Yeah. But wasn't that good though to have it that deep? They took care of water in the basements all over the place. That's about it. Now, in this case, they dug on one side of 10th Avenue, and they dug on the other side to find the sewer. Can you beat that? No, they had no records of it. No records. So they dug a hole here and a hole there? I said, I had to get a hold of the old timers that put the stuff in. They know. To find out for them. In what section of Rockville was this now? Was it in the old town or was it outside? No, this was on this side. On this side. Yeah. 11th Avenue or 11th Street or? Nowadays. That started with Halstrom. They know where the sewers are. Oh, Halstrom. So he straightened out. Boy, does that guy know what he was doing. They got to lay him out on maps, architects' maps. And he put a lot of sidewalks into Halstrom, didn't he? Yeah. Oh, sure. Halstrom was a good man. Oh, it's a picture of a guy. So you knew him personally? We were very good friends. We used to go to picnics together. It's a little, you know, Stan Johnson in Love Park and the Halstroms. And he was able to speak in both Swedish and English. Oh, he did beautiful. Yeah. He was born in Sweden. Yeah. Oh, yeah. But he talked just as good English as he did Swedish. So whenever they had a little trouble over at the Halstrom, he could handle it. He did. So he got in on the... Oh, yeah. Boxing used to take his wife down there. What was the name of your order? Oh, to Doris the denial. Doris the denial. Doris the denial, I always picked his wife up and took her. So you didn't have time for any Swedish organizations, though, like Vasa and Viking and Lyran? I belonged to Vasa. You belonged to Vasa? Yeah, we did. But you didn't participate on the board? I quit. He didn't have time. You had too much work? Why, sure. I can't drive at night. Well, then you didn't. Oh, but at that time, I mean, back 50 years ago. We didn't go as much at night as we did. We belonged because we had friends there. So when there's special doings, then we were there. I can't drive at night, no. No. But your work at that time took your whole time. You were occupied. I don't know what to tell you. 15 hours a day. Oh, there was times. Aren't you going to come home pretty soon? Yeah, I got to do so and so first, and I'll be there. Well, I'll have something to eat when you come home. Well, I'm not that hungry. I said, I'll have it ready, and you come home. So you never had any vacation then with Joel? No. Once, we went up north one time, way up north. Walter and Elizabeth were married at the same time as we were. And we took the car and drove way up north. Do you remember when we found that place? We didn't find a place to sleep, so they told us that the kids had a playhouse. We could be glad to live there. So we laid on the floor in that playhouse. And the lake right in front of us. So 6 o'clock in the morning, we were out swimming. Those were the good old days. Oh, I tell you, half of Wisconsin was our home at that time. Saturdays, usually, quite often, we were ready when the men came from work. About 12, we had lunch ready and everything else, packed and ready. And off we'd go, go as far as we could up north. But you were happy when you married Joel, you could write home to your mother. I married to a bank director in Rockford. I never told them that. Well, you were though. Well, sure, but I never bragged. They didn't even know whether he was digging ditches or had a tool shop. I told them he had a machine factory. And that's what you told them? Yep. Nothing about the bank? No, I really didn't until I got home one time and they all started to question me. And I was talking about when Joel was in the bank, oh, was he in the bank? Yeah, he was the bank director. My gosh, that's what, that wasn't anything. I didn't think that was. Oh, boy. So you did pretty good then from Shinarumba to Rockford? Yep. Just think now you've been home on the farm. You married a farmer there, you know, with a couple of cows and maybe a few more. I could handle that too. No difference? I can milk cows, I can do anything. When we moved out here, we was 40 acres, we had a big barn back there. That was before this big garage was built. And we had cows, we had chickens, and our daughter had a horse. So you think that was the reason he moved out there, so you could get a couple of cows to milk and... Yeah, we had milk and we separated. Keep your bits on the farm. We had butter and we had eggs and we had really, oh, that butter. That was during the Depression you moved out there. That was in 1940. Oh, 1940, after the Depression? 1941. I know it was something like that. So there was a good investment then. Oh, yeah, 40 acres. And you are still here now at 90? Yep. You're keeping... who is running who here now? I mean, who is the boss? Well, I don't know. Nobody is really the boss. Our son-in-law lives over there, he has his to say. And our daughter, she does all the mowing and Joe buys the mower and she does the work. And then, Lisbeth and Walford, my husband and I, their daughter and son-in-law built the house next door. Well, they're gone. So this is all family operated? Yeah, so that belongs to another party, but they're very, very nice neighbors. Then the next one, they built a little house below there. Lisbeth and Walford, my husband and I, they built that little house. So their little daughter built the next one. Now they're gone, all of them, but they're very nice people there. Then our daughter built over there and then we got an empty field on the other side of them. In between Pat and Chris and the mowns, there is some room for another house. You know that. Just like you all said, everything expands to the east. Yep. And then... You did the same thing. Way up there, we let the trees grow up in the pasture. I'm waiting for them to come way up to the building. Oh, this your land all the way over there? Oh yeah, all those big trees and all that. So half of the pasture is full of trees now. So I said, the dead, you know, they're going to come right up to the buildings. We get our son-in-law, he's quite a guy. He might go and cut down some of the little ones if he didn't want to come up. I told him, now remember, you're responsible for this now. I said, well, someday we'll be gone. The interview with Joel Jernberg will continue on cassette number four. End of this cassette.
