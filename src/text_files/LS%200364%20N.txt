 Yes, I did. I had an accident right after I got my license to drive. Grandpa took me out to get my license, Grandpa Wielander. And I got my license, and then my mother had a cousin visiting here over Labor Day, and I was going to go over and get them, and take them to Rock Island to see this Osterman lady, you know, down there. And I was going up the hill over here on 12th Avenue, and there was a man in front of me that had some boys in the back seat with balloons, and I was watching them. And then he, there was a girl walking up the side, and he waved at her. And I looked to see who he was waving at, and he stopped to pick her up, and I smashed right into his car. So I came home, and the whole front end of our brand new car was smashed in. And my husband was sitting out here on the step, he was waiting to go and play golf. And so there I came with a smashed up car. Oh great. And he said, get back in it and drive it. You know, he says, you won't drive anymore. And he was real nice about it, and I got back in and drove and went down to Rock Island with the smashed up car. But from then on it's been better. Right. Do you have a Volvo? That's what we had. I had before I got, it wore out. I can't have something that isn't running, because I don't know how to handle it. So I liked it though. So you had your experiences in many departments of life. Right. It's been an interesting life. I just thank the Lord. It's been great. I've enjoyed it.
