 Yes. Herman Hallström, so he was in the army then during the same time? Yeah. You were drafted then to what outfit? To the army? Huh? Did you go into the army? Did I what? I was in the army. For how long? Yeah. Well, that wasn't too long. I was married and that probably was somewhere around three months, three or probably a little more or less. I don't know. I used to have a, where was it, throw away from rock, where I was, was up to the camp grant. Camp grant? Yeah. You stayed there the whole time? Yeah. I was there. I think I was in, I think we went out the 21st of August. But how, what year was that? I was during the, during the army. Oh, that was 17, 1917? Yeah. Yeah. So you only had to serve then three months? Huh? Three months, that's all you? Yeah, about three months. And then you came back? Huh? Then you came back to Rockford? Yeah. I mean, to town there? Yeah, I was there in Rockford because I had a house. I had a house and my wife was in there while I was in the army. You had any children then? No, no children. No children then? No. I, let's see, no, we didn't have any. We didn't have any children at that time. But I had her and I had a house. That was, I bought the house when we got married and I had a paper on the house. So when you came back then from the army, did you go back to the restaurant then, biking? No. You didn't? No, I couldn't. I couldn't. I had to sell, bought the restaurant and the cigar store when I got in the army. You had to sell it off? Yeah. So your wife couldn't run it then? There was no way? No, no. But you were only a few miles away though, at Camp Grant. I know, I know. What happened to Larson? Huh? Oh, he's... He sold out? Or you had to buy him out? What did you do? No. He didn't give me any money, so... You didn't owe him anything? No. I gave him the money, but he didn't give me any. So you were the sole owner? Yeah. And then you had to sell the whole thing? Yeah. Yeah. So then you were free, Herr? Huh? Then you were free, Herr? Yeah. I had a salad and I thought that was the best way to get rid of it, and then I didn't have anything to do with it. And then I went to the machinist trade. Søndrand? No. National lock? No. I went to... To Matteson. Oh, Matteson. Matteson machine work. There's where I worked pretty close to 50 years, I guess. Oh, I see. But before we start, Herr Norr. Huh? If we go back a little bit now to the cigar store, what did you sell now in your cigar store? You sold cigars? Oh, yeah. We sold cigars. Tobacco? Yeah, tobacco and pipes and... How about cigarettes? Magazines. We had magazines and paper and... And snuff. Yeah, snuff. And tobacco. How about cigarettes? Yeah, there was only one cigarette. Just one? Yeah, that was Fatima. Fatima? Yeah. Who smoked that one? I mean, did the Swedes use it? That was all that smoked, the cigarettes. Fatima was the only cigarette you could buy. Did people use pipe more than snuff? No. Like the Swedes now? Well, I don't know. What did they buy? I don't know. They bought all of it. You sold a lot of snuff? Yeah, I sold a lot of snuff. So all the people now that worked at the furniture factories, they couldn't use any cigar or smoking stuff? No, no. They had to use snuff? Yeah. Because they were not allowed to smoke. Yeah, well, that was more handier for them to use snuff and use pipe, you know. Did you import the snuff from Sweden? No. Everything was made here? Yeah, everything was made here. We had Gothenburg, Stockholm, Kalmar. Nordköping. Nordköping. All that snuff was, you buy that from the... You didn't send it from Sweden then? No. Nothing was imported? No. But you used that name on it, though? Yeah, oh yeah. Well, we had to use... What did you use now? I mean, you could choose the best brand, for instance. Did you smoke pipe or...? I smoked cigars mostly. Oh, cigar? Yeah. How about the regular workers now? Did they use cigar? Huh? The regular worker? Yeah. Did he use cigar in his daily work? Well, no. That was all people that had an office in... Better people? Yeah. Funeral directors and doctors? Yeah, yeah. How about Urbom and Axel Olsson? Who? Urbom? Urbom. Do you remember him? Yes. Did he smoke? I don't think the old man smoked. He didn't? No. And his boy is probably dead. I don't know. Was he a good doctor, according to your judgment? Oh, he was... Urbom? He was a pretty good... He had the sugar pills? Pill doctor. Oh, that's what they call him? Yeah. The pill doctor? Yeah. Did you go to him? Yeah. I had him once, and he was a pretty good guy. There was another one by the name of Olsson. Axel Olsson. Alfred Olsson. I don't know what his name was, but I know his name was Olsson. But Urbom, I remember him. And he had two kids. He had one boy and one girl. And the girl was kind of a large woman for her size. But the boy was... I say he was about your size. What was he doing? Was he a doctor, too? No. No. I don't know what he was doing afterwards. I can't tell that, because I didn't have that much with them to do. Tomorrow I know the old man. So was it a pretty good business to have the cigar store, selling newspapers? You got a lot of traffic. Oh, yeah. A lot of people. There was a lot of... A lot of... Did you sell candy and chocolate, too? Yeah. That, too? Yeah. I sold other small things that they used. You know, we used to have an extra collar for shirts. For the shirts, yeah. You sold that, too? Yes. We sold that. And we had shirts once in a while, too, sold. And anything that we could sell. Because the most we sold was the newspaper and magazines. And this store was located at 4th Street, or was it? 4th Avenue. 4th Avenue. And 7th Street. That was second door from the corner, northeast corner. So after you came out of the service, then you sold it off? Yeah. Was it easy to sell it? Yeah. Well, it wasn't really to get what you wanted for it. But you made some money on it, though. You didn't lose anything on it. No, no. How was the times now, 1920, 21, and 22, 23? Was it bad times in Rockford, or was it easy to get a job? You know, a lot of immigrants came in then from Sweden. No. Was it good times? Well, it was good times sometimes, and poor times sometimes. I don't know. You start at... I know 1910, or in there, that was a bad time. It was like a depression. Yeah. And so was 1927 or 28, whatever. I was working for medicines, and I designed a new machine, a grinding, surface grinder. And I worked there, and 1932, we had the first machine ready for sale, a surface grinder. And then during the war, they sold like so fast that we could make them for them. I don't know. I thought... I counted one time that they had sold 50 machines a month, for some months. So there was a big factory. How many were you employed there? How many were you working there? Oh, I don't know. There wasn't so many. I can't tell you really how many we were. We were in the gang I had. We were some around 15, 20. I see. But you produced about 50 a month. Yeah. So how did that affect you now? You came in here as a... you were a farmer first out in Iowa. You were a farmer first out in Iowa, then you became a glass factory man. And then you started to run a restaurant, and then you bought a cigar shop, and then you became a machinist. How was that changed now? I mean, how did that affect you? Did you like this machinist job? Or you had to start from the beginning. That's something I can't tell you. You liked it if you made more money. Oh, you did? Yeah, I did. But no union there at Madison? No union? No. No union? No. But you still made more money? No. And you had your own house? You had your own house? Yeah. Yeah, I had my own house. I built that. I had that...I bought that when I got married. Oh, so you had some savings then? Yeah. I bought the house when I got married. And then when you started to work for... Madison. Madison, yeah. What was your bank then? Security on Broadway? You didn't have any money in security banking on Broadway? No. No. I always started with... Swedish Bank? Swedish Bank, and they were on 7th Street. I started the first...the building where the 7th Street bank was at that time. That was built in 1912 or something. I think that was useful first. First built. Well, I think the bank started in 1960 or something like that. And then they built the bank building, and that would come right in there sometimes. From 1940 to 1900. But that was a good bank though. Yeah. It was a good bank. And they made all kinds of money. They were the ones that had the drive-ins, you know. They had... They started with that. In the L, they had drive-ins. I think they had four of them. And that's where they made all the good money to build a new one. I don't know how they do it now. So when you started at Madison, then, you had to start as a toolmaker or machinist or what did you train yourself to? No, I trained myself for assembly work. Assembly work. Yeah. I was the assembler. And then we come into 1929. When the crash came. Yeah. Depression. Yeah. Did you own any stocks at that time? No. Only savings in the bank? Yeah. So what happened then? You could sleep all night and you had paid for your house? Yeah, well, it was there. You were able to keep the house during the Depression? Oh, yes. Yeah. Did you have work most of the time? No. You were laid off? No. Well... I was laid off just a short time in 1934, I think it was. 1930. Well, that was not bad. You could keep working then during the 1931, 1932? I kept on working most of the time, but that was a couple of months, I guess, I was laid off too. What year did you become a citizen? That was 19... let's see. That was after 1912. That was when you went into service probably, 1917? Yeah. Yeah. With the service. That was in... I had 1912. I only had one paper then. And that should be after 1912. I don't know which year it was now. I got... So you were able to vote then? Huh? So you were able to vote for President of the United States? Yeah. So who did you vote on? Wilson? Oh, I... Hoover? I don't remember which one. That was an Englishman. Coolidge? Huh? Coolidge? Coolidge? Yeah. Yeah, I think... I can think that. I think that's the one that was on the boat when I went to Sweden. I think I... But who I voted on, I can't remember any of them. How about during the Depression? Depression? There you had Roosevelt or Hoover. Who did you vote for then? Roosevelt? No, I don't think the one that I voted for got in at that time. Roosevelt then? No. Roosevelt, I voted for him one time. So you were a Democrat then? Yeah. I was... You were a cigar-smoking Democrat? Yeah. Did you belong to any organizations now, like Vasa, Switzerland, Svea, Lyran? No. You didn't belong to anyone? No. How could you avoid it when you had a cigar shop? I was with Svea Sönder. Svea Sönder? Yeah, one time. But not the rest of them? No. And good Templars. Oh, you belonged to them too? Oh, yeah. I was a good Templar. Oh, I see. So you know Stephen Northsea then? Huh? Stephen and Albin Northsea? Yeah, well, I don't know them. Bertha Larsen? Yeah. You remember her? Yeah. Yeah, yeah. Bonnie Carlson? Ny-Ny... Nyquist. There was a baker. He was a good Templar too. Yeah. And you? Yeah, yeah. I remember him. And you? Yeah. And you? Yeah. And you? Yeah. And you? Yeah. And you? Yeah, in that way, yes. And you? Yeah. I remember him too. And you? Yes. And you? Yes. And you? Yeah. And you? I remember that, yes. I know. Well, you was a good Templar too. Skovksberg. Huh? Skovksberg. Newunktvat. Newunktvat. Newunktvau. Oh, I see. I think... The very first one. Yeah. Scandi and Abelanto. So you met some of the real old-timers there. P.A. Peterson, Frank Hoagland, Hugo Olson, Willard Brolin. Yeah. You remember Brolin? Yeah, I think I do. And Axel Rindberg. You remember him? Jacobson and Rindberg? Yeah. Oh. Yeah, he was... He was a temperance, eh? He was a good temperance. He belonged to the same losses that I did. Scandi, yeah. Did you belong to the Swedish gym club? Yeah, I organized that. You organized it? Yeah. For heaven's sake, tell me about it. What year? Oh, God, I don't remember. I don't remember. I was there, one of the first ones that organized that. Swedish-American Athletic Club. I used to belong down on South Main Street by a nigger, Gareth. His name was Gareth. And he had a club on South Main Street. It was on the west side? Yeah. And I used to go down there all the time. Lifting weights, boxing? Yeah. Were you a boxer, too? No, well, I did a little of nothing much. Wrestling? Wrestling, I did that. I did that one Christmas Eve, one time, down on South Main Street. There was another fellow by the name of Johnson. He was a little smaller than I was, and we wrestled at New Year's Eve on South Main Street. Was there for the exhibition and for the public? Yeah. So what happened? Did you...? No, nobody went. Nobody? No. How did you dare walk over there to the Main Street on the west side? What? How did you dare walk over there to all the Irish people and Italians on the west side? Oh, yeah. They always said, the Swedes, they were fighting all the time. Yeah, no, they used to fight. They did? Yeah. Oh, you remember that? No, yeah, I remember it, but that was before my times, really. Before you came in 1904? Yeah. Or 1905? Yeah, that was before my time. So you never saw any fights then on the bridge there? No, no, no. I never, never did. You never saw that? No. No? But I heard about it. But there was still a little tension there, though, between the Irish and the Swedes, though. I don't know what it is. I don't know what it was. There was some big mouth guys somewhere. They did it, huh? Yeah. So after you visited the west side, you figured, you know, we're going to have a club here on the east side. Yeah. So you were one of the organizing members, Swedes. Swedish-American Athletic Club, yeah. So you had meetings then, every month? Yeah, yeah. And I bought a punching bag and a platform for it, and I gave that to them. I don't know what they have, not yet. And I was, when I had a cigar store, then they come in there and I had the keys for the place. And I sold the keys. I think they gave me 25 cents for each key they used. Oh, I see. Yeah. There was like a... No, I haven't followed athletic for a long, long time. Did you play soccer also? Yes. You did? Yeah. But I was not too good with it. But there was a short fellow by the name of Oscar Carlson. He married a girl by the name of Swanson. He had an ice cream parlor on 7th Street. They did that. And he was a painter by trade. He was a soccer player? Yeah. He was a good soccer player. And there was one that he had trouble with downtown one time. They called him... what the hell did they call him? Just a common little guy. He wasn't very big, but they had trouble with him. He put in there, cleaned the whole police force. Oscar Carlson? Yeah. His name was Carlson. I don't know. It was a bus Albin. Yeah. You remember bus Albin? No, I don't know. Albin Peterson. Yeah. You don't remember him? Who? They had so many different characters down there. You had Vildsvinet. You remember him? Nektargalen. Nektargalen. I haven't heard about that. Some of the guys that slept in the railroad cars up there on 11th Street. Yeah, yeah. I know. You can't recall them, huh? Yeah. Well, I was with him many times when he was playing soccer, football. But he was a strong guy then. Fast and strong. What? Oscar Carlson. He was a strong guy then? Yeah. Yeah, but how could he clean up the police force? You had Oscar Lindstrom. I don't know, but they had a lot of trouble with him. Yeah, well, you remember Oscar Lindstrom? Yeah. The Swedish cop? Yeah. Oscar Lindstrom? Yeah. And Bargrain? Yeah, Bargrain. I talked to Bargrain many times. He was the police chief? Yeah, and he was a good guy. Huh? I can remember when they built that police station, my brother-in-law and I, we went down there to see it when they first had it ready. Oh. And that was in the first part of the year, I guess. How was Herman Hallstrom, though, as a mayor? Oh, he was... In your opinion? Yeah, well... He was three times? I don't know. He was a one-way guy, I think. He was a good worker and had an idea of his own, I guess, or probably many others. But he didn't do any better than anybody else. Was he better than Blom? Huh? Was he better than Blom? Blom? Blom? Yeah. Oh, yeah. He was a pharmacist. Yeah, Blom, he... well... You continued then to work at Madison for how many years? You said 50 years? Yeah, pretty close. Pretty close? Yeah. Madison, they were Swedish. What? Were they Swedish or Norwegian? Norwegian. Norwegians? Yeah. And they were good to work for? Yeah. You had a good pension plan and hospitalization and everything? Yeah. Well, he did have it, but that went broke, I guess. It went broke? Yeah, but they had an organization that we had, but some way it went under now, so they didn't have any now when I left. Nothing at all? No. But it wouldn't have been good then to have a union? No, it wouldn't be any good. So either way it was bad? Yeah. You were working for so many years, no, you worked for 50 years. Yeah. Don't you think you were entitled then for some protection when you got old? Yeah, well, they had it, they had a part of it. There was one time, but some way it went... Kaput? Nothing. And when, I don't know when that went, but they had something that was protecting us some. But you didn't get anything then when you retired? No. Only what you paid into Social Security? That's right. No. This is page two, cassette two, continuing with Joseph Johnson, Rockford, Illinois. Cassette two, side two. And I was sitting up in the office for a little while, until I got tired of it, and then they wanted me to go out on the road too much, and I didn't care to do that. So when I was 70, I quit. Quit then? Yeah. Did you get another job then, or you stayed home? I stayed home. You stayed home? Yeah. How many children did you have? I had two. One boy and one girl? No, both girls. Both girls? And one died in 1931. Oh, I see. I had her in Chicago, and you know, it's funny, you got a doctor here, and he says to you, well, I know somebody that can probably fix her up. And that's just to get away from you personally, that you have, that's my idea. You mean here locally, he didn't want to be responsible? He didn't want to be responsible. So he sent you to Chicago? Yeah, he sent me to a doctor in Chicago. What was wrong with her then, do you remember? I don't know, she was going to school regularly, and then her hands and fingers disformed a little bit. And I took her to a doctor here, and he says, I can't do anything to you, he says, but I'll see if I got a doctor in Chicago, and maybe he can do it. So I went into him, and he took the case, but he couldn't do anything. And he used to say that, I guess, so to get rid of the responsibility. And she was only a few years old? She was nine and a half. Nine and a half. Yeah, she was in school, and she caught this terrible thing, whatever it was, in school. And your other daughter, now, she is living here in Rockford? I haven't got no more, she died. Both daughters are dead then? No, just one. Yeah, one daughter is living. Yeah, one daughter. And she lives here in Rockford. Yeah, she works at Union Hall. In Love's Park? Yeah, in Love's Park, in the jewelry department. So, you got the car as soon as you got to Rockford? What? You bought the car as soon as you got to Rockford here? No, no, I've been here a long time before I bought a car. Oh, how many years? Oh, God. But you said you liked fishing. How did you get out fishing then? By car. Yeah, did you go with somebody else? No, I had a car around... The 20s? When the war stopped. Oh, 1917? Yeah. Then you bought the car? No, I had a car, got through when I sold the cigar store. Then I got the car for that. And I had that as long as I could. The trouble with that first car, I had tires that didn't stand up on them. The tires were poor. They didn't get good tires until they started with the balloon tires. Then they got good tires. So you had trouble? Yeah. So where did you go fishing now? Up to Lake Geneva or Wisconsin or where? Most places that I went was up to Lake Robesa. I don't know how many years I did go up there. Every Saturday and Sunday we went up there. Where is that located? In Wisconsin? Yeah. That's just... Other side of the border. Yeah. That's about 60, 64 miles I believe it is. Oh, that's between Beloit and Madison? No, between Rockwood and Robesa. That was about 64 miles or something like that. I don't know. I can't remember. Did you have a cabin up there then? No. No? We didn't have a cabin. We had a tent. We had a big tent. We had a house on the road and we asked the storekeeper if we could keep the tent up there in the basement. He says that's all right. So they were there all the time. We went there every Saturday and Sunday. We went up to Lake Robesa. There was another fellow by me and his name wasn't Hammer. He was a Norwegian. He was born in Chicago, but he came to Rockwood when the camp grant to military place. Then he came to Rockwood. So he was there to Rockwood. Him and I was together and his wife and my wife. We were always together. Every place one went, the other one went with. We had a good time all the time. So at this shop you worked now for Madison, were there more Norwegians there than Swedes? No. More Swedes? More Swedes. More Swedes? There wasn't very many. Were there many Norwegians here in Rockford? There wasn't too many Norwegians. More Swedes though? Oh yes. Much more. How did you work together with the Norwegians? Were they easy to work with? Oh, they were easy. Oh. Did you work with Italians and Irish people? Oh yes. I worked with Italians. How were they to work together with? Was it a different opinion? I don't know. I didn't care too much for them. I don't know. They were kind of sly. They didn't speak out like most of them do. Was it easier you think to come together with people through sport, like wrestling now and boxing? Oh yes. You get to know them better then? Yes. You get to know them better. And it didn't matter if they were Irish or Italians then? Yes. That doesn't make much difference. There was no difference then? No. But in the workplace, there was difference? Yes. When you had to work eight to ten hours a day together with them? Yes. Well, that was a little different. You got to fend for yourself? Yes. You got to make yourself understood and don't try to brag too much about different things. They didn't like that? No. Nobody did. You had to keep them quiet a little bit. At least I did. So you didn't have any union problems at your shop though? No. But there were some problems though. In 1938, the National Lock was a big strike. Oh yes. And even after the war, I understand, the Second World War. Yes. In Ingersoll, I belonged to the union when I worked in Ingersoll. Oh, you worked there too? Oh yes. For how long? Oh, not too long. I worked there probably a year or so, a little bit there. But there was a strike? Yes. And those unions, it seems to me that they are directed by somebody from the outside. Why is that? I don't know. You don't have any local people representing them? There's always someone from Detroit or Chicago? Yes. This has been the case? That's the idea. They probably get, when they hire somebody like that, they probably are good talkers and turn around. Do you think the local people would be too soft to talk with the management? Yes. They're easier to convince? That's right. And outside it doesn't have that problem? That's the problem. But I blame some of them anyhow. They're not honest. That's the most I don't like about them. But in your case, say now. Yes. If you had a union at the medicine shop, then you would have a pension perhaps and hospitalization and everything. You know, like Sundstrand? Yes. They have a fabulous union. Yes. And the retired people, they have two, three hundred dollars a month, maybe even more coming in every month. Yes. Why wouldn't they work with medicine? Why couldn't you have your own union there? I don't know. I don't know. That's something I can't tell you. They just peed it off? Somebody that's outside, they think they can do better than anyone that's locally. But there was no outsiders coming into medicine though? No. Medicine? No. What is the name? Is it medicine or medicine? Medicine. Medicine. Yes. There was no outsiders coming in there? No. No, they didn't. They didn't like them. They didn't like the organ disease. And they were all against it. This struck one time, I don't know how it came out. That was after I quit. I don't know how it came out. I don't think it came out. But you worked there for 51 years. Huh? You worked there for 51 years. Yeah. And no pension. No. Don't you feel bitter though? I mean, what the heck, I mean, all your lifetime is in there. Yeah, they had a... You could expect something to come back to you though, I mean, when you retire. They organized there one time, and I had a... so they got a little bit of whatever, but however, that went out. It seems so, some way. Did they sell out? I don't know what happened, because I was not much for the Union anyhow. I belonged there one time, but when I noticed the way they distributed the stuff, like money, when they had a strike or something like that. Some of them got the money, and others didn't get anything. And I didn't like that it was fair. Did you go to the meetings they had every month? No, I only went to one meeting, I think, in Omaha. Oh, was it there? Was it trouble? Yeah. You should be represented every month. Yeah. And speak your piece. Yeah, that's right. Don't you think that's why they get away with it? Yeah, that's right. Because nobody comes to the meetings. No. No, they... I didn't like the way they distributed the... The funds. The money. Oh. Yeah. So, I never... I belonged there, though. I never cared to go much there. I tried to get my money after somebody was on a strike. I forgot what day it was. And I was down there two or three times, and they said, You haven't got anything coming. And I never got a cent from them. And you couldn't do a thing? No. So? And I never got anything. And you never questioned it either? I mean, you didn't try to find out... No, but I questioned it to them while I was there, but they couldn't do anything. And you'd been paying in dues all the time? Yeah. But then after that, I didn't pay anything. I quit. And there was a local officer in Rockford? Yeah. What unit was that? UAW? I forgot. That was the Machinists' Union. And we did help the furnace worker one time, too. You did? Yeah, we did. And I forgot what I did give them, but I gave them around $25, I guess. Oh, they were on strike then? Yeah. The furnace worker was on strike. Yeah. So there was tough times in Rockford. Yeah. So did you go back to Sweden the second time? No. Only one time? One time. One time I went. So you never saw your brothers and sisters in Sweden then? Huh? You never saw your brothers and sisters in Sweden then after you left 1910? No. The second time you went back? No. I mean the first time you went back? No. No. Did anybody other than come over here to visit you? Yeah. I had my sister's boy, the oldest. He come here. I took him here. He wanted to come to America. To stay here? Yeah. So he was here. He died here about six, seven years ago. Oh, I see. He was not too old. Yeah. He had a little welding outfit down in Bayern. Oh. What was his name? His name was Oscar Carlson. Oscar Johnson. And he had done something for the county down there. You know, they got a swimming pool. That's off from the main river. In Bayern? Yeah. Near Bayern. And some way he welded something for the county there. I don't know just what the heck it was. And he died there about, might be ten years ago now. I don't know. So do you have any contact with Sweden? Do you write back and forth now? Oh yeah. I wrote all the time to my dad. When you were here? Yeah. But do you write any letters now? Do you receive any letters from Sweden now? Oh yeah. I received letters from them too. From the kids? Yeah. Who are still living? Yeah. When I wrote anything too, he wrote or had somebody to write because he was pretty old when he died. He was 97. Your dad? My dad. 97? Yeah. Yeah? How about the rest of your brothers and sisters? Did they reach high age too? I don't know. You are the oldest one of the whole bunch. No, I don't know anything about all the rest of them. I know all about the last marriage. I know all of them pretty good. The others? My first marriage, I don't remember much of them because they were all grown and married and had kids and lived way away from home. So I didn't bother with too much. I only wanted to go home and see my dad and mother and that's where I went 1910. How old was your dad then at that time? In the 60s? No, no, no. That was before I was married too. I must have been around 25 I guess. 25 years old when I was older. But your dad, how old was he then? Did he look old to you? He died some, I don't know, maybe too many years ago. He was 97. My mother died in 31, but I don't know how old she was. I know she was quite a bit younger than my dad. She died in 31 and my dad died in 25. And the way it was, my mother, she was at least 14 years younger than my dad. You mentioned earlier how you were fishing up in Wisconsin. You kept that fish then for your own? Yeah. Also? Also, yes. Did you freeze any of it or did you? Oh, we froze a lot of fish at the place. We bought boxes about so big and so deep and about the same weight. And we cleaned them and put all the fish we could in the box and that filled the box with water and that froze them overnight. And put the cover on there and they were just the same as they was fresh. And you brought those boxes with you home? Yeah. So you had a freezer home here then? Huh? You had a freezer home here then? Yeah, well. That was not during the 1920s, that was in later years. We went fishing all summer long from the beginning, like in March or April, like it is now. We went up to the lake and we come back and sometimes we fish more for panfish than anything else, bluegill. Oh, I see. Bluegills, we could, I know when we come, we were four people, we were two boats, four people. We come home and had 80 bluegills or something like that in a bag. And then we cleaned them and put them in these small boxes and put water on them and froze them overnight and then we took them home. So, sometime we probably had 25, 30, or maybe 40 or 50 boxes. With you home? Yeah. So you ate a lot of fish then? I've been eating a lot of fish. It's supposed to be good for you. Yeah, that's probably why I live longer. A lot of fish and no drinking? Yeah, well I took a drink once. After you left Scandia? Yeah, I took a drink. But no church? No. How about Yule Ota now? Did you go to Yule Ota here in Rockford? Oh yes, not very often though. No? No. Which church did you go to then? Sometimes Zion Church. Zion Lutheran? Yeah. And we had a church up on Washington Street too. Bethesda? Yeah. Yeah, we went there too. So where did you live now here in Rockford? Huh? Where did you live in Rockford? Where did you have your house? 320 Washington Street. Oh, there where you lived? Yeah. Sure. Third Avenue is coming out and that's like Washington Street. Because on the other side is houses. It's not too far from Shaw Street. Huh? Shaw Street is close by. Yeah. And St. Louis and... Yeah. And Second Avenue goes through, but Third Avenue stops at Washington. And Hudson's Avenue goes through. That stops at Shaw Street, I believe. Yeah. Yeah. So there where you lived. And then there is a street that crosses, but that's one block from Hudson's Avenue. Hudson's Avenue I think stops at Shaw Street. So you know Victor Olsen then? He lives on Hudson's. Yeah. Victor Olsen? Yeah. You know him? I don't think I know him, but I know him. He's close to 100. Huh? He's close to 100. Is he? Yeah. Huh? On Hudson's Avenue. Huh? And there's another old timer, Edward Ring. Yeah? The old detective here in Chicago, or here in Rockford. Oh? He's 103. Oh? Edward Ring. Oh? He was a brother-in-law to John B. Anderson's father. Oh? You know the politician? Yeah. Oh? You don't know him? No. I don't think I know him. I didn't know since I started to work in a medicines factory. I don't know. I was not too much into it. We went out fishing instead of… Organizations. Yeah. So when did you buy this house on 328 Washington? I bought that when I got married. Oh, and you stayed in it all the time? I rented a house on 6th Street and State Street. It was named Lee. I think the street was named Lee, but now lately they changed it, so it's 6th Street. I never moved in there. After we got married, I bought a house on Washington Street. And there we moved in on Christmas Eve. That was 65 years ago. So when you celebrated Christmas now, you cut your own Christmas tree or did you buy it downtown? No, we bought them. You bought them? Yeah. Was it spruce or fir? Fir. We always took fir, they say, a long needle. A long needle? Yeah. Why was that? Because in Sweden there's the short needles, you know. Yeah, but the long needles last better. So that's why you changed over? Yeah, and I didn't get so much scrap on the floor either. How about your wife now? Did she have any more sisters and brothers here in this country? Your wife had a brother here, but her parents, they stayed in Sweden. Your wife's parents, they were in Sweden. Yeah, but she was here too. Oh, she went back? Yeah, she was here. She had a brother living on 6th Street. Shinburg. Yeah, Shinburg. And Leonard, Leonard Shinburg, was their son, and he used to work for electric light. Is he still living? Yeah.
