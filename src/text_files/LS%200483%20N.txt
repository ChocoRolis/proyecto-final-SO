 Yeah, I'm sitting together with Mrs. Ruth Johnson, Rockford, Illinois. She was born 12th of October in Rockford, 1915, we better put in there. And we have the 25th of September, 1986. Your parents now, John Bloomberg and Emma Bloomberg, they came from Sweden. Right. Do you know what year they came? My dad came 1906. 1906? Uh-huh. And I think my mother must have come about 1908. Uh-huh. Did they come by themselves or with their parents? No, all by themselves. So they were about 18, 20 then, or? My father must have been 22, maybe. See, he's born 1884. That would make him 22. No, 30? No, he wasn't that old. Yeah, that would make him 22, wouldn't it? He was born in 18? 84. 84. That would be 22. He'd be 22 years old then, right? 24. 24 years old. Yeah. Yeah. So he came on his own accord? No, 16 and 6 would make 22, wouldn't it? 22. Well, that would have been it. Yeah. Yeah, he came by himself. And then he brought his father and his brother and two sisters came here. Almost at the same time or? No, my grandpa came first in about 1910. And then my parents got married in 1911. Then he went back to Sweden. And then my one aunt came about 1914 and one came 1917. So the whole family came over? No. He had four children still in Sweden and his wife. And then he went back 1919 because his wife did not want to come. So you don't remember Grandpa then? Yes, I do. You do? Yeah. We called him Farfar. Farfar. Farfar, yeah. And he worked at the furniture factory here. He was a real old Swede. I saw him in 1946 when we visited there. So he was still living then? He was still living and wearing some of the clothes he had from America. And his mother, your grandmother, she living? No. No, she wasn't living when we were in Sweden, no. But she didn't want to come over here? She would not come. So then he had to go back. Go back. And he stayed in Sweden? Yeah, but he didn't like it. He really felt that he should have been here. He liked America. He wanted to stay. But he couldn't. What kind of work was he doing then when he came back to Sweden? Well, I think he... He bought a farm? No, skogmakare. Skogmakare? Yeah. But here in Rockford he was a factory... Yeah, a superior. I think he worked at a superior furniture. I think it was superior. So he liked that better? Yes. He liked America. Of course, he had four children here too, you know. Yes. So how about other children now? Do they stay in Sweden? Yep. They stay in Sweden and there's only one left in Sweden now. And then I have an aunt still living in this country. Oh. Mm-hmm. So then he came over for trying out the United States. Oh, yeah. He loved it. And your father, now, he also worked in the... Yeah, he worked at a furniture factory, but he was a glassblower from Sweden. So he started to... Then he worked in a furniture factory here. Then he worked... He left Rockford for a while and worked in Toledo with glass. Ohio. Uh-huh. I think they made more light bulbs and stuff because there wasn't any work here. That was 1917. I'm... Because they talk so much about that. And then he came... My sister was born that year. And then they came back and then he worked at a furniture factory and then he worked... He ended up with Sunstrands. He worked in a machine shop. How long did he stay in Toledo? Your... It wasn't too many months. It was a few months. So there was a lack of job there too? Yeah. Lack of work here. So then he went back... He went there and then he came back. Just before Christmas, I think. Mm-hmm. So you... But you and mother, you stay here and then... I have two older brothers. Two older brothers. You have three children? Four. A younger sister. Mm-hmm. See, my dad lived to be 92 years old. Oh, I see. Yeah, he was old. His mind was good. Oh. He enjoyed every minute. He was a strong man then? Yes, he was. Did he mention anything about the Toledo job? No. If there were any more Swedes or if there was more down there? Oh, there was a lot of Swedes there, I think. Any place where they made glass there was Swedes. Mm-hmm. But there was nothing like that around this area? No. Nothing I can remember. But he was actually trained in that kind of job then? Yeah. He also worked in... He left Sweden to get out of the army, you know. He didn't want to be in the army. Then he went to Kastrup. In Denmark? Yeah. And he blew there and then they were going to take him in the service there. Then he came to America. So he was one step ahead? One step ahead. He did not want to go in the service. Oh. Did he stay with you then or... Your father? No, I mean... It was your grandfather. Did he stay in your family? Yes. When he was here? Yes. He lived with my parents. Oh. So your father and he bought the house there? Yes. Before you were born? No. I think I was already born. He bought the... See, I think he was here two different times. He went back once and then he came back again and then he went back to stay in 1919. Mm-hmm. So when he came back then, it was in 1920. Then there was a slack time in 1920. You probably don't remember that, but there was... Around here, you mean? Yes. For my dad? Oh, it was slack. It was around 1917. And I don't... Then, of course, it got so slack after, you know, in the end of the... In the 30s. Oh-ho. Then my dad lost his home and everything. But it was so closed off? Yeah. It was nothing. No work, period. That's when all the furniture factories left Rockford. It was nothing. So what happened then? Did he have to... He had to give up his home and then he'd probably work a day here or a day there because he wanted to work. Swedes are known for work, you know. They don't like to have any welfare if they can help it. So then he lost his home and I had a brother that was working in the store, so... And you were old enough to remember this then? Oh, yes. I remember. It was... You never had any money. How did you move in with somebody else then? No. When they lost their home, then they moved into a place that was much cheaper. I think we paid $11 a month upstairs. But whatever he put into the house, that was gone. So what happened then? The bank demanded full payment of the house or what? No. See, he had a mortgage with some kind of real estate, I think. And when you don't pay, then they just take it. So there was no money even to pay down the small payment every month? No. He was only supposed to pay about $45 a month rent, I think, or you know how they pay in a mortgage. But he didn't even have that. See, my brother was the only one working and he made $10 a week. He didn't think about going back to Sweden at that time? I did. No. Never. He never? He never wanted to go back. But you would think he would have gotten mad at things and... Yeah. No. No. He wouldn't. And that happened to a lot of families. Oh, of course, I only know what happened around here, but it was... my aunt and uncle, the same thing. See, it was tough. But Eric now, he never... he lost his job, of course, but he never had to get any welfare. Where was your husband? Yes. He didn't need any welfare because he cooked in a restaurant for his meals. So then he didn't ever have to... So what year did he come, your husband? 27. 27? Mm-hmm. And he came to brothers and sisters here? No. He didn't have a soul. Not a soul. Not anybody he knew. Well, he knew... he went with a friend that was coming to his brother or uncle, and that's who he came with. Because there was Tiddeholmars in Rockford, see? Tiddeholmars, yeah. A lot of Tiddeholmars. Oh. How did you know it was them? Did you join Värsköta Klubben? Well, they was not on Värsköta Klubben at that time. No. He bought the Tiddeholmars. Oh, Tiddeholmars Klubben was here? Mm-hmm. Yep. There was over a hundred there, or 150? Oh, it must have been a lot because I've seen a picture, and the picture must be that long. A big one. Yeah. Oh, and they met once a month, or picnics in the summer? Yeah, I think they had more picnics in the summer, I think. And they had a Tiddeholmars Club after, but, you know, like everything else... Oh, you didn't join that until you married, though? No. I never belonged to it, never. So what happened... you went to school in Rockford? Yes. And you were confirmed in the church here in Rockford, Sweden? Not in Swedish. No? No, no. Everything was in English here. In English. What church did you belong to? Your parents belonged to them? They didn't belong to any. But you were confirmed? No. My brothers and sisters were, but not me. Why? Why did they... Well... Were you a younger one, or...? No, I'm the third. The third. Third. And, sorry to say, but I was a little bit proud, and I started, but I knew there would be no money for new clothes, so then I just quit. And you started to work then? No, I wasn't old enough to work. You couldn't get any work. I did housework for $2 a week. You couldn't get a job. So it was also hard for a young man to get a job? Oh, yeah. Unless you were in housework. Housework was plenty, too. Well, I don't know if it was plenty, but it was some. But you didn't pay too much? I got $2. That wasn't so much, was it? Because you could buy more for that. And there was no hours. You had to stay there doing dishes until 10 o'clock at night. No. I took care of some kids, and it was five days a week. But I had to make meals for them, and they always left the dishes for the night before, so I did them the next day. So that's why we're not afraid of working. It's different with the kids today. It's different. They don't know what work is. Did you go over on the west side to work? No. I just stayed on the east side. Somebody was working, and they needed someone to wash the dishes. Are they Swedish families? No. They weren't. Neither one's Swedish. So the Swedes were not able to employ anybody? Not that I know about, they weren't. If there was some on the west side, I don't know. They did their own dishes. They're not proud. I think they are now, maybe. But at that time, it was a tough time. It was tough, yeah. So your dad, he was laid off then from the furniture factory, and they closed up, and they moved down south? Most of them just closed up, and now there's a few of them down south, where it was cheaper help, I guess. Where did he get in then for another employment? He worked at Madsen's. That's a machine shop. My husband worked for Sunstrands, so he got him a job at Sunstrands. I think that was in 1936. Then it started to ease up. Yeah. My dad worked there until he retired, and he was over 70. And he didn't want to retire. No, he lived to... He wanted to work. He loved to work. Then he worked at the golf course after. I see. He was... He was ambitious. Athletic, too, then, in a way. He was. He loved sports of any kind. Baseball, football, golf. He played golf. Did he play soccer? No. So your father-in-law, he didn't play soccer? No, no. He was just a spectator. Spectator. But he loved to play golf. He played golf until he was in his 80s. But it wasn't that kind of unusual, though, in the 30s and 40s to play golf. It was a little later, maybe, than that, than in the 30s. Later 30s, maybe, he started. But, you know, it was unusual for a Swede to do that. That's right. And for a Swede to like to watch baseball. It was also unusual. Yes. And both my mother and him were avid Cub fans. How did they get into that one? I don't know. My father loved any sports. And then your husband, of course, he was very athletic. Yes, he was. He was there when he came from Sweden? Yes, he was. So he had the ling gymnastics already in Tidaholm. Yes. And he brought them over here, so to speak, and he was the leader for a big group. Yes, the Swedish-American Gym Club. And there was both boys and girls, or men and ladies? Yes. He was leader for both of them? Yes. But then they did gymnastics exhibitions together. I see. And you were also... Yes, not very good, though. I just took part a little bit in some calisthenics. I couldn't jump or anything like the guys could. And they had practice every week? Yes. I think we practiced on Thursdays. Of course, they could go up there a lot more than we could because they were... During the Depression, they didn't have anything to do, so they were probably practicing a lot? All the time. Oh, I understand. Well, they were up there. They couldn't play cards up there. No? No. They could play chess and checkers, that's all. But no cards? No cards. And they would bet gambling, and then they wouldn't want that, you know. So they were strict then? Well, they had to be. Were they temperance people most of the time? No, heaven no. No, they were not. But they could not play cards because then there would be arguments, and they didn't want that. So they had the strict rules then? And same with the women, could only go on Thursday night. That's the only night they could come. Did they have dances up there Saturday nights? Yeah. I can't remember if they had them every Saturday, but they did have them. And that was down in downtown? No. The first one was opened up on Broadway. That was before Erie came, but then you know where Broadway is? Yes. It was between Broadway and 15th Avenue, between 8th and 9th Street, above a garage. Oh, I see. And they also had wrestling? Yes. They had wrestling and boxing, and I think they also played a little basketball up there. And they also had baseball teams in the summertime. So which one was the bigger group, Vega or Swedish American Gymnastics? Well, I think Vega was the biggest for the simple... You mean the lodge? Yes. I mean activities of athletics, like soccer and gymnastics. Well, see Vega didn't have much of that until just before the war. Then they had a youth group. I see. Yeah, they didn't have any before that. And then the Swedish Americans ceased to exist? Well, no. They were in existence at that time, but they gradually went down after that because they... Like everything else, everybody gets too old. There was during the war, then? Yes. It just ruined everything. It disrupted the whole... It disrupted everything. Everything. So Erie Rikna, was he called in service? Nope. He was too old. So he didn't have to go? No. But then they had to work long hours during the war time. Yes, they did. Yeah. So they put activities off too, then? They couldn't... I see....be active as much. No, but then after you get married too, then you don't. Then you like to be home a little bit too. You had your own home to take care of. Yeah. So most of the people then in the 30s, they had apartments. Yeah. A few of them had their own house. Yeah. And everybody that we knew bought a house or built a house. How about your parents? Did they buy a house after it was closed? Yes. How many years later? Let's see. We moved here in 48. So they must have... They must have moved up there around 19... They bought a house at 49. I think it was the year after. And then my mother died at 59. And then my dad sold it and bought another one. So he waited almost 20 years then before he... Yeah. They wouldn't buy anything until they could pay for it. They would... They paid for it. Cash. They were damaged enough the first time. Yeah. They had to go outside to pay. How about putting money into the bank now? There was also a little bit of luck on them. Did they lose any money in the bank? No, they never had much money. But there were people who lost money. Oh, yeah. And Eric had money. My husband had money in the bank, but I think a couple of months before they closed, he... Him and Silencium took a trip out west, so he drew his money out. So he didn't lose any money. But they make people aware, though, that they should be careful. Better to have them under a pillow. I think so. But see, there wasn't that much money around, I don't think. No, but even $100 would be a tremendous loss. Oh, at that time, you could live months on $100. So there was... How about your dad now? Did he have a car? Yes, that's where his problem was. He liked cars. He had a car since 1923. And he'd get it paid for, and he'd buy another one. So, I mean, that's why they never had any money. So he had a car up until he was 88. So he had a car during the Depression, then? Yes, he had an old car, and he could drive it once in a while when he could get money for gas. But then it was only 20 cents a gallon. But it was still hard... Oh....cents to get hold of. It was. It was. Did he belong to the Temperance? No. No. He belonged to Lyron. Lyron, the singing club. How about Vasa? No. The only one I can remember that he belonged to was Lyron, and my mother belonged to Norton, I think was the name of it. Norton. Yeah. And there was a sick and a benefit charge. Yes. Yes. I think that's what a lot of Scandinavians did. They were the only insurance they had, then, if they were sick. Yeah. Yeah. Oh. So, when did you join Vega now? When your husband... Yeah, because he was already born there ever since he came from Sweden. Well, he joined... Was he a Temperance man in Sweden? Yeah, he had a... What do you call it? Transfer. Transfer. Uh-huh. So, I joined in 1932, maybe. I see. And you married what year? 34. 34? Uh-huh. So, you joined them before you married him? Oh, yeah. How about the other three sisters and... sister and brother? One brother lives in Wisconsin, and my brother died and lived in Ohio. And then my sister's also Temperance. She belongs to Rockford Lodge. They all belong to... The other two, my brothers didn't. Well, my brother had a tavern. Oh. My... That's completely opposite. Yeah. He had one in Wisconsin. Well, he had one in Rockford, too. But my other brother was a salesman for Sunstrance in Ohio. I see. So, that's... Eric had got him a job, too. But Eric didn't stay there. They stayed there, but Eric didn't. So, he left Sunstrance? Yeah. He went to work for John S. Barnes in hydraulics. I see. Uh-huh. So, he got a better position. Yes. Uh-huh. He was a engineer then after a while? No. No. He just was superintendent. Superintendent. Uh-huh. And then he worked there 28 years. And then he went to Stones Hydraulics and worked there for 10. Uh-huh. Then... So, did they have as good benefits as Sunstrance at Barnes and... No. No. But, see, they didn't... He didn't know that at that time, right? No. He didn't know that at that time. Sunstrance is wonderful. But they had a strong union. Oh, yeah. See, now, where Eric worked at Barnes, there was no union, and Stones, there's no union. And they were not able to compete with Sunstrance with salaries and wages? No. But, see, Eric went into... They had made hydraulic pumps where Eric worked, and they didn't... I don't think they got much oil pump business at Sunstrance anymore, but they did have for a while. But Eric got a little disgusted and left. So he got the training over at Sunstrance. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Able to... Yeah. So, he was not without a job then after the Depression. He was all... He all worked. Didn't have much time off. Oh. So you married then in 1934? Right. With Eric. And who married you? Justice of the Peace, Rowling. Justice of the Peace? Yeah. So he was not a Church member either? No. Not at that time, he wasn't. Oh. Then we joined after. And then you had a big wedding at... No. Just a little wedding. Just a little wedding with your... Husband and... With your parents and... And then our Lindstroms were with us. Oh, I see. Friends, yeah. Because Eric, he didn't have any relation to the whole world. Not any. Not any. Never had even a cousin in the country. Oh. So he had to move into your family, then? Yes. Uh-huh. Oh. So, when you went to high school, there was no Swedish classes? No. No, nothing in Swedish. Not at that time? No. My grandson wished it was now. Because I have one younger than this one. And he would love to take Swedish. Oh, but there's no offer anymore. There's no offer anymore. Why wasn't it offered at your time, though? Because there were a lot of Swedes there. Yeah, I don't know why. Did the parents impress on it or anything? No. No. It got to be so that... Because if you lived in a certain area of Brockville, you never... The older ones never had to learn English, you know. Oh, they were Swedish all the time? All the time. But see, when we started school, we were four kids. Then it got to be English all the time. So the parents were not anxious, then, that you were going to speak... We did. Write Swedish? No, no. I can't write Swedish. But speak Swedish. Yeah, speak Swedish. And understand. And understand. We all can speak Swedish. How about this workers' group, Arbetarklubben, in the 20s? Did your father belong to that one? No. No. When he came back from Toledo, for instance? No. He never belonged to the workers' club. Oh. I don't know why. Because there were quite a few here in the 80s. Oh, they were. But they were kind of anti-government, too, I think. So they were... The people didn't like them, at least the church people didn't like them. Well, I think it was mostly Scandinavians in that workers' club. No Americans? Not that I know about. Because I know a few that were in it, and they were Scandinavians, see. So I really don't know. They sold the paper, door to door, or delivered. That I don't even remember. You don't remember that. But it disappeared during the Depression. Yeah. Everything disappeared. Do you remember if anybody went back to Sweden during those hard times? Yes, there was a few that went back. They belonged to the gym. They went back. Oh. So how long did Eric now continue with the gym? Up until the... Up until the early 40s, I should think. Early 40s. Because then a lot of them went in the service, or they moved... A lot of the Swedes left and went to California, even before the war, right? Well, let's say, 36, 35, 36. There was quite a few from Rockford that went to California. And they stayed there? They stayed there. They liked it there. And your family still left? Well, I think most of those fellows were single that moved out there. So there was a bad time here in Rockford. It was rough. See, Rockford at that time was predominantly furniture. So there was not too much Laxon Strand then? Well, it was, but it wasn't big like it is today. But I mean, I think that was our main... Well, see, there was, I don't know, how many factories. So they depended on the furniture to hold on them? Especially the Swedes. Yeah. There were some knitting companies in Rockford and that too, but I really don't think that... Well, there was a few Swedes working there too, but you know, it seemed like they went to furniture. You didn't work in a knitting company, John Nelson? No. And when Eric came, he worked, the guy he worked with or lived with for a while got him a job at Winnebago. Knitting? No, Winnebago Furniture. Oh, furniture. And then he said, he'd been there about a year, he said, when he came, he said, if I come from Sweden to lift one piece of wood to another, to a cart, and then all day, he says, there was no object for me to come here. So he said, I went to Sun Strands in the morning and asked if I could have a job, and they said yes, so I started that same day. So he learned the trade then? Yeah, he learned trade here. He didn't have a trade when he came from Sweden? No, no. That's why he came, because he couldn't really get a job in Sweden, he said. So he didn't work in a match factory or any other... No, his father didn't want him to work in a match factory, because his father worked there. So he came over here instead? Yeah, he came over here instead. But here he found a lot of Tidjeholmare. Oh, yeah. They lived on Smedjebakken, or what they call it. Smedjebakken then was just where the blacksmiths lived in Sweden, wasn't it? Yes. Yeah. A size......sign instruments. He knows where Smedjebakken is. Yes, he does. Well, it isn't there anymore now. So did they help each other, the people from Tidjeholm, to get each other a job, or when it was possible, you think? Oh, I think they did. Because here he could have had a job, this person that got him a job at Wembego, he was from Tidjeholmare, and then he was offered a job at a lock company that also was at Tidjeholmare. So he could have. But then he had already promised the other guy, so he didn't want to change, he said. So they tried to help each other, when it was possible. Yes, yes they did. Yeah. And you didn't belong to Tidjeholmsgruppen? No. But Erik did? Erik did. Did he continue with that one, even when you were married then? Well, off and on he did. But, you know, after you get married, it's not the same. Did they fizzle out then in the late 40s or 50s? No. We still had Tidjeholmklub, let's see, in the 60s I think, they donated some kind of a plate with all the emblems, Tidjeholmsgymnastiekkluberei, it was all around this one, and they sent that to Tidjeholm. To Tidjeholm? I think it was, no. Is that what Tidjeholm sent to America? It was a big plate with all the emblems and their gym clothes on. And, you know, to tell us, I can't remember what, they sent something to Sweden, I mean, yeah, to Tidjeholm, from Tidjeholmsklub here too. I forgot what it was. I even looked at it. Is Tidjeholm a sister city to Rakvoll? No. No. It's not even a city anymore, Tidjeholm. It is? It's a commune. Storkommuna, but it's still a city though. Do they still call them cities? Oh, yes. Stån. I thought it was nothing. They call it Stån. Oh, is it a stån? Yeah, they call it Storkommuna, but it's still there. So, Erik, did he keep contact then with his, how many brothers and sisters did he have? Two brothers and two sisters. And they all stayed in Sweden? All stayed in Sweden. Did he go back at any time to visit them? We were in Sweden five times. Five times? Yeah. And that was after the war? Yes, after the war. Forty-six. The first boat that went to Sweden, we were on. And then you went along and you had children at that time? Nope. Didn't have any children at that time. So, there was like a late wedding trip then? Yeah. And you met his, you met the father again? No. And his parents had died during the war, so I didn't meet his sisters and brothers. And they were just like Erik, happy and easy going, you know. So, did he compare then how they lived compared to what you had over here? He wouldn't. He wouldn't? They had good jobs over there? Yeah. His brother was a butcher? Slagfaktorist. Yeah, that's what he was. And then one sister, of course, was married and had a family, and the other one was working in housework. But she was a kukurska. She had a good job. She worked for some kind of a konsol or something. And then his other brother worked in a, what do they call that? Tito... Bufors, I guess. Bufors? Yeah. That's where he worked. So, but he went down Great Sweden and he went down Great America. So, he didn't want to compare or see what... But a lot of things have changed since he left. He said it changed for the better. It wasn't all this... what do you call it? Buga for all things. Yeah. And calling people knee. It was gone. It's gone. Of course, that's for the better. So, they were closer together and more open. Yeah. But we always had such a good time when we were there. So, you stayed a couple of months then? Three. Three months? Yeah. And after that we just stayed six weeks. Four weeks one time and six weeks, I think, the other times we were there. So, he was much engaged then with the athletics during his... Yeah. He liked it. He played soccer ball here. He was on one championship team that played in Detroit. So, he was good. So, he was active during the whole 20s and... 30s. No, he came in 1927. Yeah. I think they won it in 29 or something like that. And he was pretty active, I think, in the gym until probably the early 40s or something. Then it got to be a lot of work, you know, and he worked long hours. Did he join your father on the golf course to play golf? I think he played with my father, but he played with me. So, when did you start to play golf now? Oh, about 1941, 1942. How did you get into it? With your father? I had a brother that liked to play and I had some girlfriends that liked to play. So, I played too. So, they had golf courses then in the city? Oh, yeah. How many at that time, Capone? We had three. Three? Ingersoll, Sennissippi, and Sandy Hollow. And they were open for public? Yes. No private ones? Oh, they had private ones, like Rockford Country Club, Forest Hills. I think Montecchi was the other one. So, you started in 1941? Yep. And you've played ever since? Yeah, at it. So, you are out then every week? I play every Wednesday for sure in the summertime. I thought I would be playing more now that Erik's gone, but I don't know where the time goes. I get lazy, I think. The second season of the Rockford Illinois Johnson. So, you were pretty good then? Keeps you busy, and the blood pressure's on. And Erik, now he was, what kind of guy was he? Was he easy going? Oh, yeah. Was he joining the Union, for instance? He never belonged to the Union. Never belonged to that? No, because he never worked where there was one. Because Sunstrange Union came in after he left. I don't remember what year they were in, but it… And then he came into the management position then? Yeah, yeah. And then of course there's no Union there. So, when you married in 1934, did you stop working then? Yeah, you couldn't. After you got married, they wouldn't hire you in the shop. I see. Yeah. They asked you if you were married or not? Oh, yeah. And you had to say, and then you were disqualified. Yeah, then they wouldn't even take your application at that time. Because then they figured if you were married, it's better that a man have your job. They don't think like that today? No, I don't think so. I think the women work cheaper than men. So, I know I worked in a bakery store once in a while, but I mean, I didn't have any, what you call, real… Stable job? I did after our boy got old enough to go to school, then I worked at the school. Oh, but then they didn't ask the questions then? No, no. This was 1940, 1950 something I worked for five years. But before the war, there was almost like an unwritten rule that… Yeah. If you were married, then… Well, it might have been if you'd been married already, but if you had applied for a job and were married, then they wouldn't even listen to you. Especially in a factory, because I know I could have got a job at a shop. But they asked if I was married, and I said yes, and that was it. No further discussion? No, no further discussions. That was it. So, the IOGT, you know, the Vigadat, you were active there, both you and Erik. For so many years, he joined, or transferred early. And what were you doing there? What kind of programs did you have? Well, they had all kinds… You met twice a month? I think we used to meet every Thursday. Every week? I think when I first joined, we met every week. But that was a place for Scandinavians to meet, I think. Don't you think so? Yes. That's why they had those clubs. But see, now it's getting tougher and tougher. Of course, everybody likes to drink, too. So, the social life is different, and it's harder to get people committed. Oh, yeah. Nobody wants to run it. But if you compare now, today, with back then in the 20s, were they actually drinking more than they do today, do you think? Oh, no. I mean the big population, if you take… I wouldn't think so, because I don't know how they could afford it. And the women didn't drink in those days? No, I don't think so. They didn't go into bars? Oh, no. I can't even remember any bars years ago. But there must have been some. It was unacceptable there for a lady to sit down and… Oh, yeah. I don't think you would associate with anybody… a woman that went into… She was an outcast. Outcast. Yeah, but not anymore. Now that's where you meet them, right? So, there's a change of value. Yeah. It's a change of value, yes. Completely different. The morals have gone a little bit. I don't know what's right or wrong. Were you in the Svenska Teater Sällskapet? No. You were not active there with the theatre? No. But there was also almost every week or at least once a month. You mean a vega? Yeah, a vega. Didn't they have… Oh, yeah. They had teater. Yeah. Teater. Yeah, I think they probably put on a play once a year, maybe. And then they also had two publications, Lantmannabladet. Yeah. And what was the name of the other one? I think a woman's… Lantmannabladet was put out by the men. I don't remember what the… No, not that I know about. I think it was only that one by the men. And there was the latest news. Yes. Gossip. Gossip. Yes. That was the truth. It was fun. That was John Murray Eake that wrote most of that, I think. Margaret Eake's husband. Uh-huh. So, he was the editor for that one. Yeah. He was… Well, at least when I joined, somebody else might have been before. But he was… And Alvin Peterson. I don't know. He died. Oh, the guy from Öland? Yes. I think he also had… He was pretty clever. Oh. Did you meet him? Yes, I did. I hear. So, you had a lot of entertainment, and you had dances on the Saturdays, and you had the… Well, Vega never ran dances on Saturdays. They didn't? They only had special doings, you know, where they had… I guess you'd call it like a fair, and it would run for probably Saturday, Sunday, and then once during the week, and then probably on Saturday and Sunday. That was in the fall. But see, after the war, that went down, too. That went down. That went down. Before, it used to be packed with people. You had like… What do they call it? Like, you could take chances on things, you know. It was like a fair. Lottery. Lottery and tombola. Tombola, yeah. Uh-huh. That's what they had. But I can't remember if they had dances every Saturday. Uh-uh. They couldn't have. But there were plenty of dances, though, because you had SMS, SMOS. SMSF. Yeah. And Lyron. Lyron. They all had activities. Vikings. So, on a Saturday night, then, you could go to the whole downtown area. There was… 7th Street. Yeah, Switzerland, Vikings. Yeah, there was dances most of the places there. But, yeah, I think there was probably more at Viking. I was never great for dancing. It was my husband that liked to dance. I see. Yeah. But young people could move around there. Yeah. It didn't like in one place to… Well, it wasn't that easy like it is today where you got a car. Yeah, but it was so close together. Oh, yeah. They were on 7th Street. Yes. They were walking distance. Oh, yes, because there was only about a couple of blocks between there. But today, they don't have to stay in Rockford. They'll go someplace else and dance. No, they got to travel far. Yeah, otherwise, it's no fun. And pay a lot of ticket prices. Pay lots of money, then they have a good time. Stand in line ten hours to get a ticket. Yeah, I wouldn't do it. So, they have a different… It's a different life. …idea of entertainment. Yeah, yes. Yes. So, when you were growing up now, like Christmas, was there a real Swedish Christmas in your home? Yes, yes. Lutfisk and all of it. Oh, and the Christmas tree, what time did you take it in or what day? No, that was… Shortly before Christmas? Yeah, shortly before Christmas. Probably a day or so before Christmas. A real live tree? Yes. Spruce or fir? Well, when we were real little, then we had just an artificial one with candles in. On the table? Well, it stood on a pedestal-like. But it wasn't pretty. You know what I mean? It just had sticks coming out. And there was one you saved from year to year? Yes. And then they just put candles in there. Live candles? Yes. So, it must have been a tree that wouldn't burn. But then after… Almost as I can remember, we had a live tree. And as soon as it started to shed, out it went. Out it went, yeah. And it was decorated with different things. Yes. Ornaments and… Yeah, and we kids made those candles. Yeah, and we kids made those kind of chains that's made out of paper. Paper? Yeah. Caramels? Yeah, we had a few of them hanging in a tree. And we used to take the candy out when my mother wasn't looking. Checking what was in it. Yeah. How about now, did you get your Christmas gifts, Juleklapper, on Christmas Eve? Right. Always on Christmas Eve. And Jultomten came along, and then how did you get them? I think my mother… In a stocking? No, we never had a stocking. She just… they just handed them out, I think. I can't remember if there was any… For everybody in the family or only for the kids? Well, no, they had… my mother had company, so we were about 21. Oh, I see. Yeah, and then… but there wasn't too many children, I think. We were four, and then I had a cousin. And then it was a couple of other friends, but… And then they drew names, I think, or they just gave to the women, I think. But it wasn't much, because they couldn't afford much. But my mother always saw that we had something. At least one thing, not 20 like they get today. So there was always a relation then? Mostly it was mostly relation, but then there was friends from Smolan. My dad knew from Smolan, and they came with their… And they stayed overnight in some of them? No, no, they… They were from… Rockford. They were from Rockford, yeah. So then she had the Christmas dinner. Yeah, lutefisk and kvinka and all that. Ryskynsbälling. No, gröt. Ryskynsgröt, yeah. With almond in. So it was real Swedish. Real Swedish. Yeah. And we had that too until… Last year, when we were on here, after Erik died, then we… of course I haven't had it since, but the year before that we had at my cousin's. Same thing. Lutefisk and everything. So you learned from your mother then how to do it then? Yeah. And bake rye bread and… Yes. Sprits. Yep. Sylta. Yeah. No, I never made sylta. I didn't like that. Do you like lutefisk though? No. No? No. How about the other… My sisters and brothers? Yeah. No. They didn't eat it? Nope. They did not eat it. Not Herring either? My sister doesn't and I think I ate it and my brother and brothers ate it. Not when we were kids. How come you didn't like that? I mean, because your mother and father… Oh yeah, they loved it. We didn't like the smell. My mother lutefisked it herself. Yeah, and changed the water. Yes, and you know, that doesn't smell so good. Once a day to start with and then once a day. It didn't smell good so then us kids didn't want it and she didn't make us. She was very easy going. How about… do you remember marzipan torta? You know what it is? Yes. Do you like that? Yes. But a lot of people born here don't like that marzipan because it's a bitter almond. Yeah, I like it. You like it? Yeah. How about the other sisters and brothers? I think they eat it too. At least I think they do. Yes, they do. Because we had some and they ate it. But I never had that in my home. You know, my parents never had that. It came in later? Yeah, it came in later. At least in our home it did. So there was the… and then the tree went out as soon as they started dropping the needles. Yeah, now it went. So there was no party or anything like that when you just threw it out on the street? Yeah, we threw it in the back, yeah. And you had… did you really have any chickens in the backyard? My mother did, yes. Chickens? Yeah, until about 1924 I think, then they couldn't have the ordinance. Oh, they had a zoning then? Yeah, they had an ordinance that you could not have chickens anymore. Did most of the people? Quite a few in the neighborhood where we lived on 10th Street, you know. Quite a few of them had chickens. Oh, man, then they ate 10 or… Chickens? Yeah. Yeah, never any more than that. Never any more. But there were plenty of eggs all the time? Yeah. Oh, you got fresh eggs then too. Yes. I don't like eggs either, so… but they were… You didn't like anything of the Swedish eggs? No. No, I learned to… after you get older, you learn that it tastes good, you know. So now Eric came in here, he likes new fish and egg and everything. Yeah. I fixed it for him, but I never ate it. And my son liked it, but I didn't. And at that time when you were growing up, you didn't hear anything about cholesterol? Never. No good for you, because you used to… you kept it away from you? Yeah. Did not like it. No good? No good. No good. Yeah, that's strange. How about… they always had a lot of bread to the dinner when they… Yeah. Did they use rye bread or white bread? My mother always made rye bread. Rye bread? Always. And by Christmas she put orange peeling in. Peeling? It was always the same bread. But we liked it. It was to bake every week, when you're six people. She made loaves or round cakes? Round cakes. Round cakes. Round cakes. And she baked them in the oven? Yeah. She didn't have a special stove for it? No. No. She used an ordinary oven. Just put her hand in and see if it was warm enough, you know, and then… Test it? Yeah. But I know after the Depression when we moved up on 9th Street, then we had a cook stove. So then she baked it. But boy, that was good bread. Would it taste better now? Oh, I don't know. We thought it was good. Probably we didn't have that much food, so we thought the bread was good. And you appreciate it when you get a little older. So you had a lot of bread and butter and coffee. Did you start to drink coffee early? Yes. Really early? Really. I can never… Or all of you? I can never remember that we didn't have coffee. Always. With cream in it? Yeah. And sugar. You didn't drink the coffee on the saucer, though? I have. But that was just for fun when I was older. Do you remember Farfarife? Yes. And my mother. Your mother, too? Yeah. But not my dad. And I had my aunts, too. They always did like this. And held their hands up like this. Oh, I see. Yeah. Kaffetoren, den beste. Yeah. Because I always liked coffee, but now I don't have any cream in it. But sugar. You still use the sugar? Yes. As long as I stay skinny, it's okay. Do you remember if the ladies in the neighborhood come over for a cup of coffee in the morning, for talks or anything like that, sit and talk? Oh, they used to get together in the afternoon more than in the morning. In the afternoon? Uh-huh. How did they get together and how did they call each other? They didn't have any phones in the 20s? No. My mother belonged to a club called Larkin. Larkin? No, Larkin. L-A-R. And you could get dishes. Oh, I see. Larkin. Larkin, uh-huh. And then they'd have a special day when they'd meet. Otherwise, if it was just a neighbor who would come in for a cup of coffee, there was nothing real planned for that. But they didn't bring any sewing stuff to sit and talk? Oh, yes. They never sat still. They always had something to do? Always had something to do. Always. It wasn't like me. And then they talked Swedish? Yes. And had coffee. They never went out for golfing? No, never. Never went out for golfing. Was your mother still living when you started to golf? Oh, yes. My mother died in 1969. What did she say about your activities down on the golf course there? She liked it. She liked it? Yes. She went off with you and watched you sometimes? No. No, but she liked that we played. Because I used to play ball, you know, for fun. And my parents come out every time I'm playing. Play ball? You mean basketball? No, baseball. Oh, baseball. Uh-huh. And they come out every time we play at a game. Come out and watch us. So they were very interested in their children. And they were Cubs fans? Oh, died in the middle. So they liked it. How did they get that way? Did somebody from the Cubs come to Rockport to… Not that I know about. Sell it or… I don't know. I just… Did they also go to Chicago to watch it? Yes, they would watch a lot of games. I don't know why they picked the Cubs, because I never would have. They didn't know better at that time. No, they didn't know better at that time. Yeah, that's interesting. And Eric was also interested in baseball. Yes. He liked any sport. American football too? Yes. Oh, he loved it. But he never played at all? No, no, never played. But he went and watched some of the college games, and he liked it. And that's one thing I don't care much about, and that's football. Did he referee any games later on when he stopped playing soccer? No. No. I think soccer died out in Rockport. And the guys now that play soccer here in Rockport, did they come together later on for meetings and sit and talk? Like Everett Carlstrom, for instance? No. Eric, when he probably saw Everett, he might have talked to him about it, but they never got to know each other. They never went together in sitting in their homes? No, no, no, never. The only time I ever saw Carlstrom was out at Vasa, because he went back to Sweden. During the war? Yes. And then he came back again? Yeah. His kid was pretty big when he came back, wasn't he? Yes. Yes. Forty-seven, I believe, he was. He was gone for a few years there. So him and Eric weren't of the same... Eric has always been a good temper, you know. Oh, yes. Everett wasn't... He was not a good temper, no. But he was a nice guy. But they had sports activities together. Oh, yeah. I think they played on the same soccer team. Yes. Yes. And then he'd go on to the gym, too. But he must have gone to Sweden in the 30s. So on the temperance soccer team, they were all temperance guys? Oh, Eric didn't play the temperance here in Rockford. That was a Swedish gym. Swedish gym. Yeah. And if I ain't mistaken, I believe he was the only temperance in that one. So then the young hands and... Yeah. Oh, yeah. He was friendly with anybody. That wouldn't have stopped him from any sport or keeping company with them either. But he didn't drink. He just did not believe in it. So... which was good. And he had the belief from the beginning in Sweden? Yep. Did anybody of his relation come over here to visit him? Once. In 57. 57. His brother and his wife came. And then it was 1980, then his... or 81, his nephew and his wife came over and visited him. That's all he said. So he had contact there with Sweden. Oh, yeah. Do you write back and forth now or...? No. The only thing I do now is write to Eric's niece. If I take a trip or something, I'll send her a card from there. That's all I do. But he... Eric always wrote to his parents when they were living. And to his brother and sisters after. But his father, he had to stay in Sweden. He couldn't make it back again. You mean my dad's dad? That was my father's father that wanted to stay here. Oh, that was your father's father? Yes, that was his father. Yes. Oh, he wanted... He was the one who had to stay in Sweden. Yeah. He had to stay in Sweden. And that's why he said that he wished... when I talked to him, I said, oh, you got... he had it so good in Sweden. Much better than what the old people had it here. But still he wanted to... Oh, he said, I should have stayed there, he said in Swedish. Did you meet him when you went back? In 46. In 46? Yeah. He was still living then? 88, I think. Yeah. Did he talk English to you then? A few words. Yes, you know, I... Oh, because he didn't know too much English when he left here. No, but he said... someone told me, I think it was my... his daughter here, that he wanted to learn English so bad, he would have paid somebody to teach him how to speak English. But where he worked at Superior, they were all Swedes. Never got a chance to talk to him? Never. So he learned a few words, but not very fluent. You don't learn that easy when you get older either. You have to come here when you're young, I think. Oh. Or go someplace where there's just American. So, but he still had the... Yeah, soft spot. United States in his mind. He sure did. He sure did. Yeah. What was he doing then when he returned here? Did he get a job? Well, I think he was fixing shoes. Shoeshopping. Yeah, I think that's what he did. He didn't have any... he didn't know anybody here. Your dad? Yeah. I said, how did they dare? He said, well, you just... thought you'd make a better life here. Did you notice any difference now working with other people, like Italians and Polacks and Lithuanians? You mean years ago? As being a Swede, yes? Was it easy to be a Swede in Rockport when you were growing up? Especially this end of town. But you didn't go across a river. When my dad first came, he said that was definitely... Off limits. Off limits. But, you know, after... Why wasn't that? Was it because other people in the... The Irish and Italian had been on the other side of the river. No Swedish stores on that side? Uh-uh. But no, no Swedish stores. They were all on 7th Street and Broadway. And State, I think there was a few. But now that changed after. It was after the war? Yes, after the war everything changed, I think. That's why my dad said, don't come home with a soldier or a Catholic. Yeah, but why should he be... he was not a churchman himself, though. Well, yeah, but he believed in the church, see. He did? Yeah. Same with my mother. My mother's father was an evangelist. Oh, I see. Yeah. But he died when my mother was 8. And so all she could remember of her father was, you prayed for this, you prayed for that, you prayed in the morning, you prayed at night. And, see, that was too much. But we went to Sunday school every Sunday. And they went to church when my brothers were confirmed, my sister. But they always said, never make fun of anybody, you know, if they're not quite right, because they're for the grace of God go you. You know what I mean? So they were, in their way. They had respect, and for... Oh. So, I mean, they really believed in it, but they didn't think it was necessary to go to church. And that's why they didn't join any church? No, they never joined a church. And, see, we all belonged to church, the rest of us, the kids. Oh, you later on, and, Erica, you joined a church too? Oh, yeah. Which one, the Lutheran or...? Alpine Lutheran, yeah. Alpine Lutheran. Yeah, and my sister. It was because of your kids, then? Yeah. No. Of course, our son was confirmed there, but then Eric just said, well, it was a few years back, we should belong to a church. Eric was buried from the church. But, see, that hasn't been so common, to be buried from churches like it is in Sweden. Everybody gets buried from church, right, in Sweden? Yes. See, now, here, that wasn't that common, but it's getting that way now. And so, we all brought to Lutheran church, my sisters and my brothers, my sister and brothers. But, your mother, now, her father... Michon....Själgren, he was a Michon's... I think so. As much as I can think of it, he would be, or if he was a Pink's brother, I don't know. In Alingsås? Well, it's a little town. What was the name? It's some of those small, little places, you know. And he was also a knikt? Soldat. Soldat, yeah. And he had meetings, like, or is that what you'd say? Soldatmøte? Næ. The prayer meetings? Yeah, that's what they had. So, if it was any denomination out there, I don't remember if she ever said or what. But your father said, no Catholic and no soldier. No, no Catholic. Why was he a soldier? Well, they weren't, they called them scab protectors. You know what I mean? Scab? Scab. Or like a strikebreaker. Yeah, see, that's all they do. They're strikebreakers. Of course, the blacks were out too, of course. That you never would have thought of. But it's usually a challenge to bring home somebody, you know, to challenge your fathers? Oh, I would never. I never challenge them, never. How about your other sisters and brothers now? Oh yeah, no, they married Swedes. So you didn't dare dance or date any Italians or Lithuanians then? No, no. No, no. We didn't. Was it so for most of the Swedish girls, you think? I do think so. You were not there? Yeah, I think so for the simple reason that you're just kind of stuck within your own little group. But there were some of them that married out of the Swedes and some married Catholics. They came from Sweden, your parents, no? Yeah. They got the idea more or less from Sweden probably or by friends over here. Yeah. But you were born here now. Yeah. What kind of idea did you have? You had two boys? One boy. One boy. Yeah. What was your point of this? Were you more open-minded? Yes. You didn't even discuss it? No, no, because you know what? When we were kids, we played with anybody. And things did change. So you didn't question the values of Catholics in the 20s or Polacks? No, no, no. I didn't. Because I have very good friends that are Catholic today. And I have very good friends that are very nice to me, and she's Polish. I mean she's born here, but she's Polish. But there is a difference though when you marry somebody off, I mean for life. Yes, yes. Did it work out now when the Swedish girl married the Italians? Because there are several. How did it work out? Most of the time I think it worked out pretty good. But one of them had to give up one religion though. Yes, that would be the Swedish. Did they both decide to quit religion? No. As far as I know, most of them that I know, they went to the Catholic religion. Oh, Catholics. Oh, yeah. So they were the strongest? They were the strongest. And sometimes they would change, the wife would change, and sometimes they wouldn't. So the children are raised Catholic? The children are raised Catholic. That's one of your, years ago, I don't know if it is today, that's one of the things that you have to say that you will do, you will raise your children Catholic. So they're the Swedish grandma and grandpa are in trouble. Darn right they are. So what happened to your son now? Did he marry the... No, he just married a... she's a... he's divorced of course, but she was part Norwegian. Yeah. And she was Lutheran too. No, she was Methodist. She was a Methodist. So, well that didn't work out. He married the same girl twice. Still didn't work out. Oh, twice? Yeah, same girl. How long in between then, between the first and second time? Let me see, about five, six years. And it still didn't... Still didn't work out. He lives in Nevada and she lives here. He's far away. You have no grandchildren then? Two. Two? Two boys. So he stays with you then? Yeah, he stays with me. But sometimes it would be easier to be by yourself. So you have to worry when he comes home at night? Yes. Kids nowadays, they want to be out all night. Then you are thinking about your daughter-in-law, what she is doing. No. She's been remarried, so yeah. Oh, I see. So it's harder on the kids as well. It is harder. It is harder on the kids, yeah. So this religion business is really sometimes a hindrance for people than a blessing? Well, it probably isn't so bad today as it was years ago. Years ago there were stricter lines? Yes, there were stricter lines years ago than there is today. Because I don't think that they have to give up their religion today when they get married. They don't pay so much attention to it? No. The Catholics, they are not as strong as they used to be either. Some are, but they are like anybody else, I think. In order to get along, you have to kind of give a little bit. But your generation are born out of Swedish immigrants. You are more open. I think we are. You can see it in a different way. But my parents, they weren't prejudiced against us. You weren't supposed to bring them when we could play with them when we were kids, but you didn't bring them home if you think you were going to marry them. But they always say, though, that a grandma, she can see much better than the daughter, you know. You trouble her. They used to look several years ahead. Yes. And I think sometimes it's been tough sledding for some people. Because it's very, very bad if you're not welcome at home. And then grandma say, I told you so. Yeah, I know. It's not easy, then. No, not easy, no. It's not easy. So, it's a hard decision to make. So, you think then that the Swedish people here had, the people have respect for the Swedish people in Rockford? I do think so. Honest and decent people. Yeah. Good workers. Good workers. The best mayors we ever had were Scandinavian stock. Hallström and Blom? Yep. They were good. You remember Hallström? Oh, yeah. Blom, too. But he was a turncoat to Hallström, wasn't he? He was a socialist to start with. Yes. And then he became a Republican. But, of course, that's all for politics, you know. Just so you get elected. But they were honest, I think, as far as I know they were honest. Yeah. So, they had a good reputation even among...
