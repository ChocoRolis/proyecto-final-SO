 We have 27 of September 1987, and I'm sitting together with Mrs. Evelyn Kohlstrom, Omaha, Nebraska, and she was born December 1st, 1906, in Kane, Pennsylvania. You had your childhood in Kane, in McKean County, Pennsylvania, where you grew up. Your father, now, what kind of work was he doing? My father? Yeah. Call reading. Oh, reading. I don't know what work he did. Was he working in the woods there, or in the tanneries? Well, yeah, they did a lot of woodwork. You were seven children in the family. So mother had a lot of things to take care of during a day's work. That's right. Did you have a cow or chickens? Well, out on the farm in Kane. You had a little farm there? We had, well, they had all kinds of, I can say the names of the cows on the lane, Dolly, Daisy, Dirty, Fanny, and Holstein. Oh, what was that? Was that? In Kane. Was there some kind of a cow rhyme, or was it, when you went out to pick up the cows for milking? Did you have to do that when you were? Oh, yeah, we counted the cows. And the auntie had a, with a jack of all trades, she milked the cows. And we were right there to name the cows that she was supposed to take care of. So they could roam free then up in the hills there? Yeah. You didn't have them fenced in, though? No. Were a lot of cows around Kane? Most of the families had a cow or a couple? Yes. You had to feed them? I had a lot of cows. So there was a bustling... And my, my, let's see if I can find it. You went to school then in Kane? Were a lot of Swedes there, you remember that? Did you talk Swedish then? Oh, we always talked Swedish. So when I started school, I didn't know anything except... But Swedish? The Swedish. But how about when you were playing with your playmates? Were they also talking Swedish? Yeah, they were all... Talking Swedish? They talked Swedish, yeah. So there was mostly Swedish people then in Kane? Yes. In those days. In those days, yes. When I started school, I didn't know anything but Swedish. Did you have trouble then to learn the English, you think? Or how did you... Did the teacher tell you to drop the Swedish completely and concentrate on English? I don't remember just how we learned the English. And then you went to Tabor Lutheran Church? Tabor Lutheran Church, yes. And there was all Swedish too when you were growing up then? Yes, a raft of Swedes. Were you confirmed for Dr. Beck? Yes. He was your parish minister. That's right. He was a big, heavy fellow. Yeah. I had a picture here of the... That building, anyway. I wonder what it would cost to build that today. Oh, that's expensive. Did you take Sunday school in Swedish at Tabor? Yeah, I was confirmed in Swedish. In Swedish too? Mm-hmm. Did most other young people your age take the Swedish confirmation classes? Yes, we were all Swedish. Could you pick English if you wanted to? I don't know if we had our choice or not. Maybe later on then. But your age group was all Swedish. So your mother, now she was born in Cape. Yes. And her parents came from Sweden. Yes. Do you know from where? Östergötland. Östergötland. And so did your father. What? Your father also came from Östergötland. Yes. And you mentioned that his name was Gustafsson in Sweden. Yes. And then he... He said there was enough Gustafsson's over there. Why don't you take your mother's maiden name? So that's what he did. So that's how I got to be. So your name was Evelyn Riding? Riding, yeah. Did they say Riding or did they say Riding? Jadisa Riding. Nobody else could understand anything else. I remember when somebody wanted something translated, I had to do the translating. So when I started school, I didn't know anything but the Swedish. So you were able to write Swedish too? Oh yes. Who taught you that? Because you didn't have a... Did you learn in the Sámi school or... Who taught you to write Swedish? Your mother? Oh, I don't know who taught me. That was all we talked, I guess. Talked, but I mean writing. Now there's a different story though. Well, I have learned to write. And you had six more sisters and brothers. Were they also able to understand and write Swedish? Yes, they understood the Swedish. Were you one of the younger ones or the oldest, perhaps? I don't know if I was the youngest, but I know I was... You had your choice those days, whether you wanted to be... Whether I was going to be a Swedish neighbor, if I was going to be something different. Oh, I see. When I went... My daughter's husband loves to travel. And he traveled for... And made speeches because he knew how to speak Swedish. He does? What is his name then? Ni-Re-Mi. And he understands Swedish and speaks Swedish, but he's not a Swede? No, he understood it, but he... How did he pick up there? Did he go to school to learn it or...? Oh, I couldn't tell you that. That was just... I had a picture here of a rattlesnake that Uncle Gus took. And that picture up there, I thought was just a picture. And then somebody told me, no, that wasn't just a picture because he was somebody. It wasn't just a picture. Uncle Gus now, was he your father's brother? Who? Uncle Gus? He was... I thought he was just a picture. Oh, you mean that painting on the wall there? Yeah. Saying thanks for the bread? Mm-hmm. Oh. But... But you were talking about the rattlesnake here and Uncle Gus. Yeah, I had a rattlesnake here. So this Uncle Gus now, was they your brother, your father's brother? No, I don't think he was. Just called him Uncle Gus? No, I just called him Uncle Gus. Was he from out of Pennsylvania or from Nebraska? No, and then somebody told me it wasn't just a picture, that he was... he was... he was real. But Uncle Gus now, was he from Cain or...? Yeah, he was from Cain. Okay. And they had a herd of cows to milk. And we always knew the names of the cows that they were supposed to milk. So did you have more milk than you could use for one day? So you had to churn butter and make cheese and... Mm-hmm. Do you remember doing that? Yeah. So, Dolly, Daisy, Jersey, Fanny, Ida, and Holstein. That was the name of the cows? That was the name of the cows. Did they come then, when you called their names? Yeah, they'd go down... we had to go down to the pasture and round them up in the... in the pasture, wherever they were. Were you able then to see which cow belonged to you and the neighbor and so on? Oh, yes. No problem? They knew their cows. They knew their cows, yeah. Uh-huh. Yeah. And nothing happened to them? They were all... They were always right there. And they went up... they... did you have a barn for them during the winter end? Have what? You had a barn in the wintertime? Oh, yes, yes. Because it's cold up in Cain. Oh, they must have been thir... They must have been thir... It was winter, yeah. It was winter. The cows didn't go out there, did they? Yeah. Yeah. Now it's not Christmas. And when Grandpa... I don't know the relation exactly right there, but... couldn't... couldn't speak Swedish. And when Dad left Sweden, they told him to take his mother's maiden name, because there were lots of Gustafsons over in America already. So you take your... your... That's what happened, yes. Yes. How's the church now? You went to church every Sunday? Yes, yes. We had to go. You were in Luther League and... Yes, I was in Luther League. And there was... And when... Somebody couldn't talk Swedish anyway, and they had me translate what they were trying to say. So Dr. Beck, now, he spoke good Swedish? Oh, yes. And she is now about 600 miles north of where we have a summer cottage. Dr. Beck's daughter or... Oh, we'll see. No, that would... It'd be... His daughter. Related to the... To him. To him. Uh-huh. He was a pastor there for many, many years. Yes, yes. And he was also with Uppsala College in East Orange. So did he encourage you girls and boys not to go to college or to higher learning when you took the confirmation class? You remember that? I know there wasn't any... any encouragement to go to college because there wasn't... No money? No money, no money. So there wasn't many who could study further then, if they wanted to? That's right. So no money? No money, no money. So it was best for the pastor to keep quiet? Yeah. And as I say, my sister's husband loves to travel. So he took me to Sweden. Oh, you've been in Sweden? Oh, yes. I've been in Sweden. Where my father... my father... Birthplace? Yeah, my... Do you remember the place you visited then in Östergötland? The name of the place? No, that I wouldn't know. Kisa, Mjölby, Skjendinge, Serby. You don't remember any names? No, I can't remember. How many years ago was it that you visited Sweden then? Oh, that's quite a long time ago. When you were younger? A good many years younger. Did you go with somebody then from Kain or... No, this traveler lives in... is one of the doctors at Mayo Clinic. Oh, I see. And none of them like to go and make speeches. So that was after you left Kain and you went to Sweden? Oh, yeah, that's right. But if we go back now to Kain here and you... after confirmation, what kind of work did you take then? You went out to the... to try to make a living for yourself. Did you have a boyfriend then in Kain? Oh, I don't remember any boyfriends. No? You didn't go to any dances at that time? What? Any dances? Oh, we used to square dance. In Kain? In Kain, yes. You know what square dancing is? Oh, yes. What's it like? Ja, det var roligt. Det var roligt, ja. It was dancing. Ja, men inte sköttis på polka och sånt? Ja. De sköttis på polka också? Ja. Did you dance the charis and the polka? Oh, yes, yes. Excuse me. So you were quite a bunch of young people then in Kain? Oh, yes, we were. A lot of people? A lot of people. How far did you go then for different square dances? Montjuic? Yeah. Smetport? Yeah. Port Elegany? Port Elegany, yeah. Port Elegany, yeah. That's it. And how John Smith? John Smith. John Smith. And how did you get to Sweden? I went to Sweden. I went to Sweden. I went to Sweden. And how did you get to Lithuania? Lithuania, that's it. And how Johnsonburg? Wilcox? Yeah, I believe so. Or Renovo? Yeah, I think they... But it was part of, you could take the train to some of those places, Warren, and you had good train traffic there in Kain. The train went by. Kain was Kain. Yeah. A great place. It was the center for the whole thing. Yeah. And you had many churches. And Dr. Beck was a great pastor. So the Lutheran church was the big one. It was a big one. But you also had the Covenant Church there, Bethlehem Covenant Church. Yes. It was not as big, though. That one I didn't... You didn't go to that at any time? Didn't know anything about that. Did you associate anything with those members of the young people that went to the Covenant Church? Do you remember that, if you had some girlfriends that said that they were members of the Covenant? Mm-hmm. No, I can't tell you anything about that. So you kept together and all Lutherans kept together and the Covenants by themselves? Yeah. There was no Baptist church there? No, I don't remember of any. Oh. No. Did you learn anything about the local history of Kain? Why it gets its name... was it Colonel Kain or Lieutenant Kain or was it the military men that bought the land? Mm-hmm. He had a big house up there? Yes. Very historic house. I wish I had that picture of that rattlesnake. Give me that. Not this. Were there rattlesnakes in Kain? There must have been. But you never saw any. Oh, I'm sure I saw eyes. Because when you rounded up the cows for milking, didn't you see any snakes down there in the grass then? I don't remember seeing any. No bears either? No. Oh, that's the Kinsley Bridge. Oh, yeah. Did you go there for excursions? Oh, yes. That was fun to go there. And now they are having excursions to take people to see this place. It is going to be a... A big treat to go to the Kinsley Bridge. Yeah. But how did you go there? Did you walk then or did you take the car or... Did you have a car there? No, I never had a car. And your dad didn't have a car either? Oh, dear. Do you remember if your dad had a car? Dad never had a car. No? No. So they had to take the train then if they wanted to go to Wilcox. Yes, they wanted to go, yeah. Or Warren. Now, this is Pastor Bernard with his two babies. I see. I was going to send that to him for a safe. And then you mentioned there was a contest in your church, in Table Lutheran Church. What kind of contest was that? Make a speech about missionary work. Oh, I see. So who had taught you the missionary work then? Did you read something special about it or... Oh, that I don't remember, but... The young people had to do that? The young people did, yeah. If you could talk Swedish and... And English too? Mm-hmm. This is a picture of my husband standing outside of the house we lived in. Here in Omaha? Yes. And what happened then? You had to talk Swedish then, make a speech in Swedish? Yes, yeah. Also English? Yeah. And it was at the Table Lutheran Church? Mm-hmm. And what happened then? Well, I won all along in making the speech. So my last speech was in... about the Bernards, when his children were very little. Lucy, my daughter, and these back girls were... They were friends? Yeah, they were. They could call the cows by name too. Oh, I see. But your daughters, no, they never lived in... I mean, your daughter never lived in Kendall. No, no, she didn't. But she learned it from you then to call the cows? Mm-hmm. Linda and Binda and Holstein. Mm-hmm. And so you went to different places then to go on to this contest? That's right. And you talked about missionary work in Africa or China or where? Do you remember that? Evidently it was Swedish. It was in Swedish, yes. Mm-hmm. And then you were sent to Omaha because you won this contest? That's right. And what was that? Was there some kind of a prize then because you won this contest? Well, I was... that's how my first trip to Omaha. How old were you then? Oh, goodness. Twenty? Who knows? Amberlee. I've got great-granddaughter twin girls. Oh, I see. But you don't remember how old you were when you won this contest? Well, I won the contest in Omaha. You won there one, too? I won all along, so I got to go to Omaha. Mm-hmm. And one reason I could do that was because I could talk Swedish. That was one of the favors you... Mm-hmm. It paid off then to know Swedish? Yeah, it paid in degrees. Did you go alone then on the train from McCain? Or did you have anybody with you, your mother or somebody else, chaperone? Yeah, there was others that went to this convention. Here in Omaha? Mm-hmm. And you don't remember what kind of work you were doing at that time in Cain? Horse work or...? Well, I guess the only work we did was helping the cows. So you stayed at home then until you married almost? Yes. I see. So when you came to Omaha then, what happened then? Then you met E.A. Fogelstrom, the reverend. Before I left home. Oh. He said I would be a guest of E.L. Fogelstrom while in Omaha. He was the founder of the Immanuel Deaconess Hall. That's right. And that's how my first trip to Omaha got to be. You came here to meet... you had greetings with Dr. Beckton? That's right. Because they knew each other. That's right. And I still know Mrs. Beck. So when you came here to stay with Dr. Fogelstrom, you stayed in his home? Yes. And he had a boy? That's right. Ernst Luther Fogelstrom. Ernst Luther Fogelstrom. And he was about the same age as you then? That I couldn't say. A little bit older? I would say about the same age. Was he home at that time when you came? Yes. He was living at home? Uh-huh. And what happened? You won this contest and did you stay on then with Dr. Fogelstrom to help out? Or did you go back to Kane? Well, I went back to Kane for a while. And then I had to write a note of thanks for what he did for me while I was in Omaha. And so the letters kept flying back and forth. And he asked if he could come to see me. That was your future husband, Ernst Luther? Ernst Luther, yes. And you said you had to ask your mother and father then? Yeah. Do you remember that? How what? Did you ask your mother then if he could come? Well, yeah. Here's a picture that was taken very recently. It's interesting. Do you remember now what the mother said when you got this letter that he said he asked to come and see you? What did she say? I told him he could come. You said so? Mm-hmm. So what happened then when Ernst Luther came from Omaha? He had to stay overnight then with you, and you had to accommodate him? Oh, yes. Yeah, what happened then? Did you take long walks or go square dancing? Or you couldn't do that with the pastor's son? No, that would never do. What kind of work was he doing then at that time when he came out there? Was he still at home or was he at the college? Well, I think at the time he probably was like me naming the cows. Well, he didn't have any cows here in Omaha, though. Well, the last invitation to this convention, I had won a speech locally in a church. And I won in the district, and the next would be the one step higher I got to go to Omaha. That was the one that you described. You also won that one. Yeah, I won there. What kind of prize did you receive then from this? Did you receive a prize of some sort? A prize? Yeah. There was a contest, usually prizes. You got Dr. Fogelstrom's son. That was a prize enough. Yeah, that was enough, yeah. So he came then to Kean and you met. We met. And were you engaged then at the same time in Kean? No. Or did he go back then? No, I wasn't. Ready for that? No. So what happened then? Did he went back and did he tell you to come after to Omaha? What happened? What happens in my memory? Yeah, but there's such a big happening, you know, you never forget things like that. Yeah. So... Yeah, they say that's dumheter. Dumheter, ja, det var det väl inte. When two people meet. Yeah, that's right. But you had a rendezvous, you went back to Omaha again. I went back to Omaha. Shortly after. And then you stayed at Fogelstrom's home again then. Yeah. He... He had a... I don't know what I'm trying to say here. What kind of work was he doing? Do you remember that? Yeah. Well, Kean, Pennsylvania was kind of a wild country. Yeah. So he didn't like to stay in Pennsylvania, though. What? Your... Ernst Luther, no, he didn't want to stay in Kean. No. No. No. Did he say then that you were going to go to Omaha and you were engaged then? Well, not exactly. We wrote letters. You wrote letters? We wrote letters for a long time. For a long time? And then he... Oh, I don't know how long, but at least long enough that it was... But you kept the letters coming. And you didn't have any boyfriend in Kean. Evidently not. Not as important as this one. This one. No one that wrote letters to you like him? No. Like him, no? I had to write thank you for what he did. But you followed up with many more letters. And then the letters kept flying. So you went to the post office then almost every day? Oh, yes. Checking for letters. As soon as you got a letter, you answered immediately. But you wrote in English, though. Oh, I'm sure we did, yes, yes. But he was able to talk Swedish, too, though. Oh, yes, yes. How was his father now, E.A. Fogelström? What was his first name, Dr. Fogelström? E. Enst? Enst Lundström. Yeah, but his father, E.A.? E.A. Fogelström. But it was Enst. You always see only E.A. I always wonder, you know, what the E stands for, but it's probably Enst then. So how was he now? Was he a very stern fellow or respectful? Or... What kind of person was he? Did you have respect for him? Oh, yes, yes. He was very... Strict? The letters kept flying. Yeah, but I mean, your father-in-law now, the old man, how was he? Did you have respect for him? Oh, yes. You couldn't say anything you wanted to him? Oh, yes. It was, as they say, the letters kept running back and forth. But Enst's father now, Dr. Fogelström, how was he? Was he a stern fellow or respectful? Oh, yes. He was... Well, as I say, we went to the pasture to get the cows. Mm-hmm. No, they wasn't cane there. They wasn't cane. But when you came to Omaha, there was no cows to get in the pasture here. Wasn't any what? Cows? No. No. Well, yeah. You left the cows in cane? Yes. So when you came, you stayed here with Dr. Fogelström and his family? And his family. And what I asked was that how was Dr. Fogelström? Was he a respectful man? Did you have a lot of respect for him? Oh, yes, definitely. He was... Well, I don't know how to say it. This is... If you compare Dr. Fogelström with Dr. Beck, was there any difference? Well, I suppose we were with Fogelström more because my daughters and his daughters... Yeah. Well, it was later on when you got married, though, but I mean on the first trip you made out there, you stayed with Dr. Fogelström. And then his... This is site two, continuation with Fogelström, Omaha, Nebraska. Site two. So eventually you came out here to stay. That's right. And you were engaged. Did you stay then in the Fogelström's home, in your husband's father's home or parents' home? Well, it was wartime then. And he had to be one of them that were in... had been in Kane. So that when the fun was over there, why, the Bernard girls were... We wrote letters between us. We wrote letters between us. So eventually you came here to Omaha and you married and slew to Fogelström. Yeah. He wrote... we kept writing letters for a while. And then he asked to come see me. And he did. He came. And he went back and you wrote letters. So we wrote letters. Then you came back to Omaha. That's right. And Dr. Fogelström, he married you. Yeah. In the Immanuel Lutheran Church. I guess it was Immanuel Lutheran. So your parents came out there for the wedding and your brothers and sisters too, all of them? Oh, no, not all of them. Not all of them? They couldn't afford that. There was no way to do that now? No. So... They were... they were poor. No, they cost a lot of money to take the whole family. That's right. But do you remember if your parents came? To my wedding? Yeah. No, I don't remember that they could afford that. No. And... so you didn't marry the King then. You married here in Omaha. Evidently wasn't married. And then you rented an apartment. Did you buy a house? Or how did you get settled now as a new couple? When I started school, I could not speak anything but Swedish. It was in King. But here now, after you were married to Angelou to Fogelström... Yeah, yeah. You rented an apartment then, or a house? Well, I don't remember just where we went, but I learned how to... what it was to be... Housewife. Housewife. What kind of work was he doing? Well, they say that was farming country. And the names of the cows was Dolly, Daisy, Jersey, Fanny, Ida, and Holstein. Yeah, but not out here in Nebraska, though. Your husband was not a farmer. No, he wasn't, but that's for sure. You don't remember what kind of work he was doing? My father? No, your husband. Ernst. Was he in a store or office? Well, it was at the time of the war, and he had to... You were too young, though. You were not married during the war. That was 1914 to 1917. You were still home in... calling the cows of the pasture at that time. Now you are fooling me. That was later. I don't understand much. You probably married in the 20s sometime, before the Depression. 1929. You married. That sounds about right. I buy that one. These are pictures of my... I have twin girls. Twin girls, yeah. And great-grandma, too. You know. So how... What do you remember now of the Depression years? They were a hard time then, when the Depression hit here in Omaha. Yeah. It was hard times. All kinds. Did you have to go to work, or you didn't work? You stayed home and took care of your children? Yes. That was a must. That was a must, yeah. That was a must. But your husband, how he worked? Did he work in the office here in Omaha? You don't remember? Well, he... Well, did he work with his father at the Emanuel Hospital or Deaconess Hall? No. I'm sure he worked with the children. He did? At the children's home? Mm-hmm. I see. When the war started... No. That was the Second World War then. Then he had to go to war. That's possible. So he was out there. It was the Second World War. That's right. And you had two children then during that time. Yes, right. So you stayed home. I stayed home. But you never worked then in the hospital or at the children's home or anything like that? No. No. I remember one time... I don't know whether this means anything in connection with what you were looking for. No. But when he went to war, he had to go. He didn't enlist. He had to go because it was... He was drafted. It was his job to do that. He was not the pastor of your husband? No. He was never ordained? No. No. No. Did he go to college, to Augustana College at any time? Yes. He was at that time. He came home. He was at Augustana. Okay. God. And he didn't want to... He wasn't a student, I guess. He'd rather go to war. How many brothers and sisters did he have? How many children were there in the Fogelstam's household? Do you remember that? Well, I know... Do you have any brother-in-laws or sister-in-laws? I... I have a... Now I'm stuck. You're stuck there. I'm stuck. It's hard to remember, though. But there is no one living today, then, of the Fogelstam family. You are the last Fogelstam's in Omaha. That I wouldn't know. You wouldn't know. Evidently. I can remember he was... It was at the time of the war. Yes. And he had to... Either he had to enlist, or they'd pick him up and take him. So he enlisted, then? So he enlisted. Was he away during the whole war? Do you remember that? No, I don't remember that. Did you stay close with Dr. Fogelstam and his wife? How was your mother-in-law? Your mother-in-law, now, how was she as a person? Was she a kind person to you? Oh, yes. Helpful? Everybody's good to me. But it was not easy to come from Canaan to a big city like Omaha. There was a big change. A big change. Were you homesick at times? Evidently not, because I don't remember that I was. But the nature is completely different. You don't have any big woods there, no bears, no rattlesnakes to talk about. Ooh, that rattlesnake. Wish I could find a picture of that. But you saw, then, Dr. Fogelstam's work here when he set up this children's home and deaconess home. That's right. It was growing and growing. And now you are here today, and it's a tremendous place. My daughter, or my sister-in-law, made vestments for churches. Oh, I see. And that... Whatever she has done. That was some of her work. And she... Well, she made that, and she made vestments for any church that wanted them. You see? Well, I see this picture you have on the wall there. Sanded use of insanning. Wooden furniture, wooden building. Here they go. Wooning. Wooning. Something like that. My memory is... you have to keep winding it up. Yeah, but you remember pretty good, though, some of those old... You remember all the names of the cars, isn't it strange? Yeah. You never forgot that? No. All of them? Vorta, Brommen, Hemavest. You think so? Well... You've been back to... you have still relation in Kean. You have a brother's son or sister's son or... who is it? In Kean? Yeah, Ridings. Dennis Ridings, for instance. That's a grandchild of your brother. Well, when I started school, I couldn't speak anything but Swedish. Have you been back to Kean lately? No. Many years ago? No. You haven't seen Kinsley Bridge then for many years? No, I've seen it quite a few times, but everybody had to go to Kinsley Bridge. It was a must. That was a must. Did you know anything about Jenny Lind? She bought some land there. Jenny Lind? Yeah, the singer, the Swedish nightingale singer. Oh, yeah. She bought some land there in Scandia, around there. You remember that? Yes. As a child, they told you that? Uh-huh. And Ole Bull, the Norwegian violin player. That's right. So you heard about that? Uh-huh. Some people say I worked for the Roman in my vest. But you've been most of your life in Omaha now? Yes, since then, yes. Since the...? At this convention. There was a beginning. I had noticed that I would be the guest of... Fogelstrom's? Of E.L. Fogelstrom violin in Omaha. And there was your luck. There was your bridegroom. I had to say thank you for what he did. Yeah, sure. No. Never do. Not to write a thank you note. And then you took the son away. Yes. Did he say thank you for that, too? Oh, sure. It just kept on. The letters kept coming. And then the last convention, I would be the guest of E.L. Fogelstrom when I was in Omaha. Were you active in the church also here in Omaha? No, that was back in Kane. In Kane, yes. But I mean, when you came to Omaha to get married, were you an active church member in the Emmanuel Church? Oh, yes. You belonged to Ladies Aid? Oh, yeah. Kvinnornas Syförening. Syförening. You remember that? Yeah, Syförening, yeah. Yeah. Did they talk Swedish here in Omaha, too, when you came here at that time? I'm afraid not. Did you meet a lot of Swedish people here in Omaha, though, when you came? I don't think so. No? I don't remember that. They were all Americans here then? It was mostly Swedish, mostly Swedish people. Here in Omaha? You mean in Kane? In Kane, when the war started, my son was at Augustana College. So your son went to Augustana? Uh-huh. And the other two? No. Just your son? And he was anxious to go to war, I guess. Well, there was your son then. It was not your husband that went to war. No, I thought. It was your son. Uh-huh. Are we correct at that? Uh-huh. I see. And as I say, I can still remember the name of the cows, but I can't remember anything else. Why is that? It's not stupid, is it? It really is. You take them once more? Uh-huh. How many were the cows now? I count them and you say them. Dolly, Daisy, Jersey, Fanny, Ida, and Holstein. Six of them. Huh? Six of them. Six. Oh, dear. So after you came to Omaha, you never milked cows again? You never called the cows in? Haven't what? After you came to Omaha, you never had to go out in the pasture to call the cows home? No, no. I didn't have to go get the cows. No? Did you write often to your mother back in Cana and tell her about it? Oh, yes. Oh, yes. Did you visit your mother here sometime? No. She never came here? No. She... No. Not your father either? Huh? Not your father either? No. You had to go and see them then? Had to be war then. No. So they were never here then to visit you? How about your sisters and brothers? Did they visit you at any time here in Omaha? You remember that? Or they must have, though, later on? No. The names of the cows is hard. Oh, dear. Did cows start sticking in your mouth? He would rather herd the cows than he would do anything else. Your father? No. My son. But they didn't have any cows then when he was growing up. No, no. He had to go by train. Well, I hope I haven't told any fibs. Not intentionally. No, no. You're doing all right. So you remember the place then when it was down on 36th Street, the deaconess' home and the children's home? Yes. And then they moved up here? And they moved up here. And this is your... this is your place now? Mm-hmm. And now you sit and think there? Yeah, I find myself talking Swedish to some of these helpers around here. You can't talk too much Swedish here, though, because there's not too many that understands it. No, there aren't many. There aren't many, no. There aren't many. But you remember the old verses and the psalms and songs and... Yes. What prayer did you use, you read for the food? You read for the food every year? Yes. What did you say then? In Jesus' name. We eat food in Jesus' name. You used that every time you sat down at the table? Yes. And you thanked the food, too? Yes. That was the end of the interview with Evelin Fogelström and Mahana Breska. And today is the 27th of September, 1987. Thank you for interviewing.
