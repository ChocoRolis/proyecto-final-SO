 There was a missing sir, if you know where that is. Anyway, there's a miller. He put up a mill, but he had to go down to Skåne to get a miller. And that was my uncle. That my father's brother. Do you know his name? No, I don't. Anyway, he come up there and he run the mill. And the first year, there was a young lad. He's out on the wing and they couldn't put the brakes on. It threw him out and killed him. And then, of course, my uncle, that's my father's brother. He called my father up from Skåne up to Vissingsö. So he was running the mill there too. This is Daniel Lindin, or Linden, as he's called in Rockport, Illinois. He's telling me this. And he was born 1896, the 26th of July, in Rockport, Illinois. And we have today, 23rd of June, 1986. And you know, my mother, she was born in Sweden and they told her to come to America. And she come to America and she started working in a restaurant. But she had to wait on tables and she couldn't speak English. So there was a couple come from Rockford and they says, oh, if that's your breed, come to Rockford. And even the merchants there talk Swedish. So my mother come to Rockford and there she met my father. But I tell you here, my father was a good writer. And oh, I wish I would have bought a pad of paper and let him write his history. So he was a good writer? I wish I, but I didn't. I wish I hadn't. He could write so very beautiful. Every letter he'd sent to Sweden, he'd have to read it to my mother because she loved his writings, you know. He wrote in Swedish then? Oh yeah. In Swedish? Yeah. Well, he would come to America and wrote letters to Sweden. And of course, when he sent the letter to Sweden, he had to read it to my mother because he was a good writer. He was a good writer. Do you know the reason why he came over here to the United States? No, that's why I wish I'd have bought a tablet and he'd have told why he come to Rockford. Why should he come to Rockford? He never told you that? No. And he never told when he met my mother. Oh, it would have been nice because he could write. Oh, he could write beautiful. And you know, my mother, she had trouble speaking English. So she had to work in a kitchen. She couldn't wait on the tables. There was a big restaurant in Iowa there. And then finally this couple come from Rockford and they says, oh, if that's your trouble, come to Rockford and settle on the east side. So they married here then in Rockford? Yeah, they were married in Rockford. Where were they married? In the First Lutheran Church or Zion? Taber? I don't know where they were married. You know, I wish if I had bought a tablet, he would have written the whole thing. Where were you baptized? I was, we were a free church. You were a free church? Yeah. I see. So you belonged to a free church. Yeah. So they were probably married in the free church then. Yeah, probably. Because they came to this country around 1885, maybe 88. Yeah. Or 1890 perhaps. You were born 1896. Yeah. Were you the oldest? No, I was the third. Third? Yeah. Oh. Yeah. And my sister, my sister's still living. She's out at Fairhaven, and she's over 91. I'll be 90, I'll be 90 coming July now. She is older. I'll be 90 years old then. And she is 90? She's over 90. Over 90. Yeah, but I'll be 90, I'll be 90 in July now. Yeah. So how many children were you in the family? How many children were you? Eight. Eight children? Yeah. Yeah. My brother was the oldest. He was running a grocery store on Broadway and Levin. What was his name? His name was Linden too. Olsen and Linden. Olsen, companion. Huh? They were called the two companions. Yeah. Olsen and Linden. He let Olsen take the first name, see? Olsen and Linden, see? Oh, I see. Yeah. And your brother's first name, what was that? Enoch. Enoch? Yeah. Enoch Linden. Enoch Linden. It was Enoch Linden, Ruth Linden, and then I was third, Daniel Linden, and then Joseph Linden, and then Esther Linden, and then Naomi and Naimie, and then the last one was David. Oh, that was a big family. Yeah. What was your father doing then? His name was— Yeah, but what kind of work was he doing? Oh, he worked in a furniture factory, you know, varnish and alcohol and stuff. So one year, he decided to go out on a farm, and he worked on a farm there, and my father was a hard worker. Oh, the farmer regretted to see him go, but he had to go back to Rockford. Yeah. Yeah. So what company did he work for, Scandia Furniture or Rockford? Union. Union? Yeah, Union Furniture, if you know where that is. No, P.A. Peterson's factory. Yeah, that's right, P.A. Peterson. You remember him? Yeah. Yeah, I remember. He was a short guy. Yeah. He never had a hat. Didn't he? That's what they say. Oh, yeah. He was a kind of little odd, you know. He was? Yeah. Yeah, but he was a good businessman, though. Oh, he was a good businessman. Oh, he owned almost the entire— He owned Union and several shops. Yeah. He was a wealthy man. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, he lived on the West Coast. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, he lived on 7th Street. Oh, he lived there? Mm-hmm. Yeah. Yeah. But he didn't have any children, though. I don't think he did. Oh. I don't think he did. Yeah. Yeah, that's right. See, you know, I wished I'd have bought a tablet and a ballpoint pen, and my dad could've—he retired, you know, and he didn't have anything to do. He could've written a very nice history. It'd been fun to read it. I could've translated it into English. So you knew Swedish, too, then? Huh? You know Swedish? Oh, yeah. Sure. Du kan tala svenska? Jag kan tala svenska. Yeah. Yeah. You see, the thing was this. We went to school nine months, and then we had to go three months to a Swedish school. In the free church? Well, sometimes I was in the church, but we had to go to a Swedish school, and, you know, I learned Swedish. So you learned how to speak and to write it? Well, I don't know if I can write so well, but I can speak Swedish. And read it? Huh? You were able to read it? Oh, yeah. I can read Swedish. I even got a Swedish—my dad had a Swedish Bible, you know. So I could read that. Yeah. Yeah, it was—we were a religious family, you know. Religious. Yeah, and so my dad named all eight children after the Bible, see. Yes, why? Ruth, Daniel, Joseph, and Esther, and Naomi, and Naimi, and Martha, and David. Eight children all had Bible names. Your name is Daniel? Daniel, yeah. Yeah. And they were shortened after Dan, I suppose, later on. Huh? They never called you Daniel, though. They called you Dan? Yeah, they called me Dan sometimes. The nurses here called me Dan and called me Daniel. They like to use the word Daniel. I don't know why they like to use that word. So when you went through school and were finished with the school, what kind of work were you doing? Well, I tell you, if a kid starts six years old, he should finish when he's 14. But one teacher held me back a half year, so my father says, oh, he's got to go to Arbeta. You know, I was 14 years old. My mother, my sister pleaded with my mother, she says, let him finish, let him finish that half year. So my mother did. So I was 14 and a half when I started work. What happened then when they held you back in school? Huh? Why did they held you back in school? I don't know why. This is a teacher that was, she was kind of crumly and all, and she held me back. She held the, she, there was two boys. They worked on a farm and they'd leave two weeks before, a couple weeks before, and I went to school with them and she figured I was one of them. So she held me back too. She held them two boys back and she held me back. Yeah. But, that was all right. So you started to work then when you were 14 and a half? Yeah, I was 14 and a half I started work. With what? I worked at Lock Company. I come up to Lock Company and he says, how much education have you had? I says, grade school. Good. He says, I'm going to put you in a tool room. He put me in a tool room three days. But down below on third floor there was a tool maker and he had a son and he wanted his son to be up there and I had to go down. After three days I had to go down the basement and thread screws while his son went up and learned the tool maker. Yeah. And then for the first time I learned something about politics. Politics, you know, see? How the bosses work, you know. Yeah. Yeah. I come up there and the superintendent, he says, we'll put you in a tool room and you learn to be a tool maker. But then this boss down below there, he pulled strings, you know. So his son got up there and I went down. So how long did you stay down there? Could you work your way up? No. I worked there about a couple years, I guess. And then I went out to Rockford Milling Machine and I learned how to run a lathe. There was one thing I wanted to do. He put me in a place called, it was automatic, you know, six different positions. So I told the boss, I said, I'd like to run an engine lathe because wherever I go I can get a job in an engine lathe. Okay. He says, when there's a little vacancy, we'll put you in. So finally I learned to run a lathe. And then I went out to Rockford Milling Machine and run a lathe out there. Yeah. So how long did you stay there? Oh, a couple years. Then I went to other places, you know, like different shops. You could always get a job on an engine lathe, you know. Well, that was easy. Huh? That was easy to get a job. Yeah. If he said, use an engine lathe operator, they'd take you in. Right away. Yeah. So then you had experience. Next time you went to another job, you had more experience. Yeah. So you added more and more knowledge. I worked different shops. Yeah. Yeah, that was quite an experience, though, when I had to go down to the basement and he went up. It was politics. Yeah, politics. You got mad then, but there was no way for you to— Nothing to do. I had to just take it. So I took that job down there. It was a machine that went like this. You just put in a screw, come out, thread it. Yeah. So he was doing that, that boy. He showed me how to do it. There was nothing to it. Just put it in. Was he a Swede, too? Huh? Was he a Swede, too? Yeah, he was Swedish, too. His name was Talander. Talander? Yeah. John Talander. Yeah. Was it mostly Swedes in the factories when you were working at your— Yeah, mostly— Mostly Swedes? Mostly Swedes, yeah. Did they talk Swedish all the time, too? Sure, they talked Swedish. On the job? Yeah. Yeah. You didn't see any Italians or Irish or Polacks or— No, they were all Swedes. See, they helped each other, you know. Yeah. But you had no trouble with your name, though, and your knowledge of Swedish. You went into every door. Yeah. You had no trouble to get a job, though. No. It was easy. Yeah. Yeah. You never figured to start to work with your brother in the grocery business there with Olsen and Linden? Well, I never got in there. You had no interest for that? When I was in there, I was already in the machine shop, see, so I didn't care to get into a grocery business. Did you have to join the Union then when you came into the factory? No. Not at that time? No, not at that time. No. No. So that was open for everybody. Yeah. So how long did you work now then in the factory? Huh? How many years did you work now for this lathe operator and milling machines? Well, I worked till—I worked— All your life? All my life, yeah. All your life. Run a lathe. So your job then, tool and die maker or—? Well, sometimes I'd work in some shop where it'd be tool and die, and sometimes I'd work in another shop just plain lathe work. Lathe operator? Mm-hmm. I see. Oh. Yeah. So how many years did you put in then? Fifty years? Let's see. Let's see. Well I'll tell you what I'd do. In the summertime, I'd work outside, you know, just common road work. You mean they shut the plant down then in the summertime? No, I'd quit my job and go out and work outside. Get fresh air? Yeah, yeah. I worked several years, and then in the winter I'd work and go into the shop. Yeah. What happened, you were talking about politics here. What happened when the Union came into the shop? You were in the work then, and— Yeah, but there was no Union then. Yeah, but later on though, in the 30s and 40s. Yeah. But the thing was, I didn't know anything about that the bosses would do that, you know. No, but later on, I mean when the Union came in. Well, they didn't have no Union then, I don't think. No, but later on, when you had worked for about 25 years, then the Union came in. Yeah. I never joined the Union. Never joined it? No. And you worked so many years in the factories? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, I worked. I'd work every winter in a machine shop, and I usually would go out in the summer. There were smaller machine shops then. Oh, yeah. How many were employed in the machine shop you were working? Oh, it was a Rockford milling machine. It was big though. Huh? It was a big company. Yeah. They had hundreds of workers. Yeah, for sure. Yeah, first I worked at Lock Company, then I went out to Rockford Milling Machine, then I worked in different shops, because you could always get a job if you were lathe-handed, if you were engine-lathe. Yeah, but I knew I couldn't get a job if it was an automatic machine, you know. So I told the boss, I says, I want to learn how to run an engine lathe. Well, he says, if we get a vacancy, we'll break in, see. So he taught me how to run an engine lathe, and I could do that. That's all I did. I never worked in the furniture factory. You know, there's a lot of furniture factories. I think there's about 30 of them. P.A. Peterson run most of them. So I never worked in a furniture factory. But your dad, he worked all his life for furniture. Yeah, he worked in polish, and he was run down, see. So one summer, he went out and worked. How old was he when he died? Yeah. Seventy? Seventy, about. Seventy. You know how old I am? Ninety. I'll be ninety next month. July next month. Twenty-six to July. Yeah. You'll be ninety. Yeah. That's many years. Yeah. A lot of years. So you were very active in the free church? No, I wasn't active in the free church. You were active? My father was a deacon. I see. But I wasn't—afterwards, I joined the free church, but I wasn't active. Yeah. And did you marry? No. You never married? Never married. It didn't work out right. You couldn't find the right one? Huh? You couldn't find the right one? Yeah, I found the right one, but it didn't work out right. That's too bad. Yeah. Yeah. But there were a lot of Swedish girls in Rockford. Huh? There was a lot of Swedish girls in Rockford. Oh, yeah. Coming in all the time. Yeah. Yeah. Oh, this was an American girl, but it didn't work out right, so I never got married. Did you join any of the Swedish organizations in Rockford? Like— You're like Vasa and Viking and Switzer? Mm-mm. I didn't join any of them. None of them? Mm-mm. How about Temperance? No, I didn't. IOGT? No. No. I didn't join anything. I just joined a free church because my dad was a deacon, and I just joined it. That was all. I wasn't very active. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. So, how was it during the First World War? Were you drafted then? What? The First War, were you drafted? World War I? Oh, yeah. You were drafted then? Yeah. So you were a deserter? I was drafted, but when anyone worked in the machine shop, they were exempted. I see. So you didn't have to go then? Yeah. So, yeah. Yeah, World War— World War I, yeah. Yeah, World War I. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, World War I, yeah. Yeah, I think even World War II, I think I was exempted, because then I was quite old, you know. You were too old. I was quite old then. Yes. Yeah. Yeah. But you had worked most of the time? Oh, yeah. Yeah. I worked—I run an engine lathe. That's all I do. What did you live in Rockford? Did you have your own house or—? Yeah. You bought your own house? Yeah. My dad, he was—we were living on 20th Avenue, renting. And my mother, she—they resented something about my mother. And she could feel that. She says, Nu ska vi shepa vod eget him. And they were walking along 11th Street, and they come to this little house. And my mother says, Nu ska vi köpa, nu ska vi köpa. So they inquired—it was for sale. And they bought that little house. My dad built another section to it. And we lived there. The house is still standing vacant now. Yeah. Så du bodde där med dina föräldrar då? Huh? Du bodde där med dina föräldrar? You lived there with your parents then? Yeah. Oh, yeah. Yeah. Yeah. We were quite a family at home there. Yeah. Yeah. And, yeah. I remember my mother, she used to bake—oh, bake bread and bake a lot of things, you know. She was a good cook. Yeah, it was a nice home. It was a nice religious home. Yeah, very religious. So you went to church then every Sunday? Yeah. Every Sunday. Yeah. I had to go because my dad was a deacon, see. I had to go, see. Yeah. But you had no trouble to understand the Swedish sermon, though? Oh, no. No problem. No problem. No problem, they'd have Swedish services, and I knew Swedish. And my dad, he was very strict about Swedish, you know. Oh, he wanted you to learn that? Yeah. Yeah, you see, I'd go to school three, nine months, three months to Swedish school. Only Swedish for three months? Yeah. Yeah. You know, the Swedes were so proud of their language that they wasn't going to let that go down. So they made their boys go to the—I remember it'd be about, oh, about 20 boys, and they're all Swedish. They'd have to learn Swedish. Were you for to learn Swedish? Yeah, I got some Swedish lessons. How about your friends, now, did they like to go to that school? What? Your friends? You said there were 20 boys. Did you like to go to school? No. You didn't? You know, the thing is, they'd go nine months to the English school, and they figured they should have three months off. And then the Swedes made them go, then, three months to Swedish school, and boy, they didn't like that. Yeah. How about the regular school, like the high school? Did they teach Swedish high school in Rockford? No, no. Why didn't they do that? You can teach Swedish the regular school year. Yeah. Yeah, they should do that, but they didn't. They didn't do that? No. No. Excuse me, one second. So do you remember the table prayer you said when you sat down to eat? Oh, yeah. It was the Swedish table prayer? Yeah. Do you remember that one? Oh, yeah. Can you say it for me? I see. How was it? I just had it a little while ago. Oh, look up. Yesu nam. for the Warsaw Maritime Union. It was a whole good night. I just had it in my mind. When you sit down with your parents to eat, you always had to pray. Yeah, we'd always pray. You always prayed. Yeah. And it was Swedish. Yeah, always Swedish. You say it, or your father or mother, who said it? Well, my father would say it, or my mother would say it. Yeah. So you kids didn't have to do with that? Uh-uh. You just followed along? Yeah, just follow along, yeah. Uh-huh. Yeah. How in the world was it? And I just had it in my mind. Yeah. Yeah, we still want to worship you, too. Yeah, that's what I remember. Oh, yeah. You see, my father, he favored the old people. You see, my father, he favored the oldest boy, Enoch. Why? Oh, I don't know. He'd favor him. He'd give him a toy or something. You know. A yule club. Yule club, yeah. Yeah, but... How about you, though? You were the third in order. You should have a yule club, too. I didn't get any yule club. Only Enoch. Huh? Only Enoch got the... Yeah, Enoch could get that, and I'd sometimes get it when it'd be half-worn out. You know, I'd get it then. Yeah, but you were eight kids now. Yeah. And you mean Enoch was the only one that got the yule club? Yeah, he... Well... How about the girls? Yeah, they'd get two. They'd get Christmas presents, you know. But you never get one. I can't remember I got any. I can't remember that I got any. So did Santa Claus come on Christmas Eve, or do you have the presents under the tree? Yeah, we'd just have the presents on a table. On a table? Yeah. My father, he didn't believe in Santa Claus. Oh, I see. He was kind of, you know... He was strict, there was no superstition. Yeah, yeah, yeah. But you had the lutefisk? Oh, yeah. My mother would buy this stiff lutefisk, and they'd cut it up and make lutefisk, and she made pie, apple pie. She'd buy a lot of apples, you know, and then she'd make apple pie, and we had good food, very good food. There was a lot of family to feed, or eight kids. Huh? There was 10 people to feed every day. Yeah, yeah. My mother was a good cook. She'd... Of course, after a while, you know, Ruth was the second one. She'd help, and they'd all have to help, you know, learn how to run a home, you know. And then one by one went out to look for a job. Yeah. And you did the same thing. Did you have to pay some of your earnings to your dad when you came home and you stayed home? No. You could keep all your money you earned outside of home? All of it, yeah. You didn't have to pay your mother for food or for cleaning the... No.... washing the pants and stuff like that? No. No, it was just a common family, but we all had to help. You had to help out to buy things? Mm-hmm, yeah, help out. Help out, yeah. It was a nice home. It was on 11th Street? 11th Street? 11th and 15th Avenue. It was 15th Avenue, rather. 15th Avenue. The house is still standing there now that he bought. Yeah, he bought it way back, but it was a good family. And then 7th Avenue, on 7th Street, where you have all the stores, the bakeries, grocery stores. Oh, yeah. And your brother here and Olsen, they had a store down there too. Yeah, I had a store on 15th Avenue and 11th Street. They had a store? They had a store on 15th Avenue and 11th? Yeah. I don't know if that store is still standing. I think it's still standing, and it was Olsen and Linden. This here Olsen, he ran a store before that, him and his wife, and then when my brother quit, my brother worked for J.P. Swanson, so when he quit, then they decided to go together, so he let him, Olsen first and Linden. Yeah, yeah. So there was a good store. Oh, yeah. Yeah. He's next to Carl Andrews. He had a butcher shop. Carl Andrews. I don't know if you remember him. No, I don't remember him. Yeah. It's so many years ago now, so I don't remember. Yeah, yeah. Yeah. Yeah. That's quite a history. How did the Swedes now cooperate with the Italians and the Irish? Well, they were kind of stayed by themselves. They did? Yeah. On the west side? Yeah. They wouldn't mingle with them, but if they had to, they would. If they had to do business, they would do business. No, for instance, when you went to school, to high school. I never went to high school. You didn't go to high school? No, I just went to grade school. I tell you, when I was 14 years old, I had half a grade left. I know. And my sister pleaded with my mother. She says, let him finish. Let him finish grade school. So when I come up to the lock company, that's Nelson, he was the super— How much education have you had? Grade school. Fine. I'll put you in the tool room. And that was— But it only lasted 3 days, see? But how come you know quite a bit about Sweden, though? Yeah. Do you mean to move on to another school? I learned the language, and I learned the history about Sweden, yeah. Did you learn in this summer school? Did you learn this history in summer school, or did you read it yourself? I'd read it myself, too. Mostly I read it myself. How many states are there in the United States? Fifty. How many provinces in Sweden? Provincial. Provincial, yeah. Provincial. Landskap. Twenty-five. Landskap. Yeah, 25. That's 25. How did you learn that? Well, I'll tell you. Over in this here Alma Nelson home, there's a chart, and it's got all 25 provinces. Landskap, yeah. Yeah. Småland, Skåne, Åland, Halland, and all the different... Österbotten, different provinces, and they got them right up there, and they're all in the United States. All those provinces are in the United States, and they... I was thinking of... I got a map, oh, about that high, and it shows the ones... different parts where they are. Skåne is way down below here, because that gulf stream comes up and heats that Skåne, and Skåne, that's the breadbasket of Sweden, because they produce a lot of grain and stuff, and yeah, I didn't know much about the other states or provinces. I didn't learn much about them, but I knew there was Öland. That's a fishing industry, and then there's way up north, there'd be this... Oh, what's the name of that city or town? Kiruna? Kiruna? No, it's Lapland. Lapland is the biggest province. I could see that on a map, and then there'd be different ones. They'd be small, like... Oh, I don't know. I can't remember them, but... But the one way down south, Skåne... Skåne, yeah.... is where your parents came from. Yeah, Skåne, and then there was... You were interested in that one. Then there was Småland. But your dad and mother, they never told you anything about their home province, your dad and mother. No. Well, my dad would tell me a little bit. He knew quite a bit of Swedish history, and he'd tell us about it. He did? He'd tell us how it was in Sweden. Did he go back to Sweden at any time? No, no, he never went back. Not your mother either? No, my mother didn't either. See, when my mother was in New York, she had a cousin out in Iowa, and she says, Come on out to Iowa. So my mother saved a little bit, went out to Iowa. She'd come out, but the trouble was, there was a big restaurant, and my mother worked there, but she didn't know Swedish English. Where in Iowa was that? Where in Iowa was it? Kellogg, Kellogg, Iowa. Kellogg. Yeah. It was a little village, and she worked there. And the trouble was, when she told her, it was a couple come from Sweden and stayed there at that restaurant, and they says, Oh... She says all the merchants, everybody talk Swedish. So my mother saved a little bit, and come to Rockford, and there she met my father. Oh, I wish that I got a tablet, and he told when he first met my mother, my mother and a lot of things like that. Yeah. But he was a good writer. How about you now, Daniel? Were you interested in politics? Huh? Were you interested in politics? No. Never? No. How did you vote now, Republican or Democrat? Republican. Republican? Yeah. How did you get the idea? Your dad? Well, my dad was a Republican, so I'd vote Republican. I didn't mind. I thought it was just vote. Yeah. But you never been interested in politics, I mean, running for school board or... No, I never run for anything. Never run for any politics. No. I wasn't interested in politics. What I was interested in was I went to an art school, and they had a—Rockford Massinity, they called it. It was a show, you know. They'd have it once a year. So I painted a picture and won $25 on it. Really? Yeah. Was it oil or watercolor? Huh? What kind of media was it? Was it oil? Oil. Oil? Yeah. Did you go to school then to learn this, or how did you...? I'd go to—they had a school in East High, and I'd go there during the winter. So I learned a little bit. We had a pretty good teacher. He's pretty good. So I won one prize anyway. Did you continue to paint? Oh, yeah. You did? Yeah. Did you sell the paintings then, or what did you...? Oh, I'd give them to my relatives. I'd give it to Enoch or Ruth or someone. I'd make a painting, you know. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. So there's some there that—I used to paint a lot. I used to paint quite a bit, but—because this class, we were three—two other fellows and myself, and we used to kind of compete, you know. So I used to paint quite a bit. I don't know. I'm not painting no more now. Yeah. I'm too old. How about your brothers and sisters now? You have one sister— One sister. I got two sisters at home. My oldest sister's at that home, and Naomi, she's at that home, too. So— How about Enoch, your brother? He's dead. See, Enoch is dead, and Dave is dead, and Esther's dead, and—oh, we're not very many left. Were they married? Oh, yeah. And children? Yeah. Naomi never got married, but Esther got married, and Ruth got married. See, Ruth lost her husband now, and she's out at Fairhaven. Yeah. So you have nephews and nieces, then? Hmm? You have nephews and nieces? Over in Sweden. In Sweden? Yeah. Well, I think most of them are here now. They come here. Yeah, they come to Rockford. Yeah, come to Rockford. Yeah. Yeah, quite a history. Quite a history, huh? Do you write to Sweden? Huh? Do you write to Sweden, to your relation over there? No. You have no contact with Sweden? No, no contact with Sweden. Nothing at all? For many, many years? Many, many years, yeah. Your parents, though they wrote letters, you said your father wrote letters back and forth. Oh, he'd write. But when he died, it stopped. Yeah. My mother didn't write no more. She didn't? No. See, my dad had a pretty good education, I think. I think he had a pretty good education. Oh, he could write beautiful. Yeah. That's a gift. It was a gift he had. How about you now? Do you have a good handwriting? You are an artist, you know, I mean, with the brush there. And how about with the pen? Yeah. Do you have a lot of writing? I mostly painted. Huh? Yeah, I didn't write much. Yeah. Yeah. It was a big family. Very interesting. Yeah. Yeah. So your parents, they didn't belong to any organizations in Rockford, only the Free Church? Yeah, just Free Church, yeah. Yeah. They didn't belong to any club or anything. No. Now, when you were working here with the factories, were you insured? And for instance, if you got hurt in the job or you got sick, did you have an insurance then or anything? No. No, I don't know. It was way back. They didn't have any insurance then. No insurance? No. Yeah, it was... What happened then if you got sick, for instance? Who took care of you then? Well, the family would have to take care of you. That's all there is to it. Oh. They were kind of loose in those days. Yeah. How about the old people now? You are sitting here now in a beautiful home. But years ago, you know, 50 and 75, 80 years ago, what happened with the old people then? They didn't have any family, no parents. I don't know. They'd have to take care of themselves. That's all there is to it. Or the state did take care of them, I think. I don't know how they worked it out. Yeah, they were kind of loose in those days. Yeah. They didn't have homes like this. They didn't have homes like this one, I mean, back then. They'd have to take care of themselves mostly. Yeah. My father, he depended on himself. Yeah. Well, most of the workers did. My dad worked up the union furniture, and each guy there would take care of himself. Yeah. And there was no union there either? Huh? There was no union there either? No union. No union. So your dad never belonged to a union then? No. Never? No. No, he didn't join any union. No. But we had unions a lot for a long time. Oh yeah. There were unions in Rockford. I was working in a machine shop, and there were unions, but I never joined any. So you didn't have to? No, you could work without joining the union. Yeah, but how about the union guys? Didn't they hackle you to make you join? Well, they tried to make you join, but I didn't care to join because I'd work in the shop during the winter, and then I'd go out and work outside. So I didn't care to join. I was careless that way. I didn't care. And they couldn't stop you from entering the plant, I mean, when you came back? You walked right in. You mean if they— The union didn't try to stop you? No, no. They never did? No, I'd work during the winter, and when they'd come around, I'd be gone. Yeah. Well, I thought they were pretty good. I could work outside or inside. I thought it was pretty good. I thought it was a pretty good arrangement, and I'd try to get along. See, I was home most of the time because I never got married. But Enoch and Ruth got married, but I didn't. Did they marry Swedish girls? I mean, Ruth married a Swedish guy? Well, they—Swedish descent, mostly. Swedish descent, yeah. When you think back, some memories start to come back, you know, things that you didn't think about. Yeah. Yes. So you think back, there were good memories of times past? Yeah. Good memories? Yeah, good memories, yeah. Do you remember any hard times or hard life or hard work or anything like that, or union problems? No, no. It was hard work, but I learned how to run a lathe, and they never complained about my work. So I'd usually work outside and then come in, work inside. See, my dad, he worked in a furniture factory, and he was in a bad part. He had varnish and alcohol and stuff, you know. Did he complain about his work conditions? Yeah. He did complain about it? Well— But there was nothing he could do, though? No. One time, he went out on a farm that one summer. To get a break away from it? Just to break away, yeah. Yeah. But he went right back in? Oh, he liked that. He liked working out there. He never realized he'd cultivate, you know. I'll tell you what happened. Why didn't he stay on the farm then, to continue to work there? Yeah, he should have stayed there. I'll tell you what happened. This farmer had about ten horses, and they were all taken up cultivating and stuff like that. My father, he had to take a buggy horse and an old worn-out horse, and he was supposed to plow that land. And he—they got surprised. A buggy horse and an old worn-out horse. And that horse was so lazy. My father got a—it was a big stack of hay, and he beat the horse, you know. And he says he worked very good that day, because he beat him up, you know. And so the farmer got surprised. He says, how come a buggy horse and an old lazy horse, and you got the land plowed? Yeah, my dad, you know, he says he made that horse's work. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, he was a good man. So you don't have any dentures? No. And he still marks them in old teeth? I got my own teeth, and in July now I'll be 90 years old. That's remarkable. Huh? That's remarkable. Milk. Is that good? You must be kidding. No. I got my own dentures. Yeah. Yeah, they say, where's your dentures and where are your glasses? Well, I got a pair of glasses. I'm going to bring them up because I want to read a little bit. I need glasses. Yeah.
