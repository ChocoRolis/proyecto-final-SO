 Evelyn Nelson, Rockford, Illinois, was born 26th of August 1906 in Rockford, Illinois, and we have 23rd of July in 1987. So you worked for Mayor Hallstrom? I worked for him for 33 years. 33 years? Since being mayor, he went into the insurance business, and I worked for him in the insurance business, and I worked for him for 33 years. But you knew him even when he was a mayor, though? Oh yes, I knew him. When did you start to work? He got elected mayor in 1921, the first time. I believe so. And he was a popular mayor? Very popular. And a good one. He was a good one? A very good one. Best I ever had. And he was elected on the socialist ticket? That is correct. So that means there were quite a few socialists in Rockford. Evidently. Did your family vote for him? Pardon? Did your family vote for him, your dad and mother? Did they vote for him? Oh, certainly. Did they know him personally, too? Not personally. Only that I worked for him. So you came into his office then after he had been the mayor. You didn't work in City Hall? I never worked in City Hall. You see, he had an insurance business. Until he was the mayor. Yeah, while he was mayor, until he had an insurance business. So I worked in the insurance office. What kind of insurance was that? Fire? All kinds. All kinds? All kinds, yeah. Casualty, what we called casualty, and like mostly casualty and fire and windstorm. Was it a big company like State Farm or Continental or what was the name of it? Well, you see, he would be an agent for them. He represented them as an agent. Many different companies? Many different companies. He didn't own any of the companies. He only owned his—I get kind of dry when I talk—he only owned his own business as an agent for various companies throughout the years. So was he active in politics even after he had the insurance company or did he drop the politics by the side then? Yes, yes. He did, yes. He owed his time strictly to the insurance business. He was in the office every day then working together with you or was he out selling? No, he was in the mayor's office. I more or less ran the insurance part of it. So he was the mayor then even when you worked for him as an insurer? Oh yes. Oh, I see. So he was at the mayor's office every day? Yes. It was a full-time job? It was a full-time job. And you took care of the insurance business? That is correct. You had to sell insurance and you had to pay all damages and your claims and everything? Well, I had to write all the policies and I had to be ready. You were in charge of it? Yeah. Not life, but fire, theft, and what we call the casualty business. And you had a lot of Swedes insured then of course? We did. You were able to speak Swedish? Yes. It was poor, but I could speak Swedish. There were many who came in and could not speak English? Quite a few. Quite a few. So you started to work for him then during the depression or before? I was working for him during the depression also. You see, we covered those years. What was the business in insurance then during that time? Could people afford to pay the insurance premiums? Well, not too good at that time. Because there were a lot of people without work? That was right. Like auto insurance for instance, did they drive without insurance then a lot of people or what happened? Well, they would take... Liability only? Yeah, liability of property damage. So you had a lot of auto insurances? Pardon? Did you have many auto insurances at that time? Quite a number. Quite a number. So then Blum became the mayor? Blum became the mayor. He was the druggist? That's right. Who was the better one of the two? Mayor? Mayor Holstrom. He couldn't be beat. He couldn't be beat in any way. He was a very intelligent person. Very intelligent. How did he get into the insurance business? Did he go and take any courses? That I don't know. But he hired you as a secretary almost from the beginning then? Well, just about. Had you gone to business college down here in Rockford? No, no. Only high school? Only high school. And you knew your typing and bookkeeping? Oh yes. I did all of the work. So you were in charge of it, but you had him nearby though. You could call on him in City Hall. How was he now as a man? Was he relaxed or arrogant? How did he take people? He was a very, very, to me he was a very wonderful person. All the years I worked for him, he never said one word. Some cruel word to me. And in fact, he'd come to me if he wanted to know something about the insurance. So he confided in your knowledge? Yes, he did. So you both had respect for each other? We did. We did. If I had to go to the bank, I used his car. And at that time, he had a Pierce Arrow. Maybe you never heard of it. It was a fancy car. Oh, it was a fancy car. And I felt so smart driving that car. I'm sure you did. You know, with that fancy. All the fancy headlights and all. So, yeah. Everybody in Rockford knew who was coming then. Either the mayor or Evelyn. Yeah. He was a wonderful person. He never, of all the years I worked for him, he never said a cruel word to me. When he retired, did he continue his insurance business? Insurance. That's correct. And what year did he die? In 1960? In 1960s? 62? I don't know. He died. I was a little hasty about it. He stayed in Rockford until he died, though? Yes. He didn't retire to Florida or anything like that? No, no, no. He stayed in Rockford. And you kept working for him all the time? Oh, yes. Even after you got married, you continued working as a secretary? I did, yes. When did you meet your husband, Arthur Nelson? How did you meet him? That's a gasoline statement. With a Pears arrow? He stopped and looked at your car? Oh, no. Somebody said. No. He only lived a block from where I lived. He only went to Rockford, where I lived. And I used to stand on the corner, wait for the bus, and he'd come out and talk to me. That's his picture. He was a very handsome young man. And he came from... He was born in Keewan, Illinois? Keewan, Illinois. And then he moved to Rockford with his parents? Yes, evidently. What kind of work was he doing? Tool and die maker. So you got married in what year? What year did you get married? 1936. And then you bought a house? We bought the house when we got married, yes. We later built a home. So you've been a professional secretary for many years? Yes, I was. So you didn't have any problems during the Depression? You worked every day? I worked every day. And what church do you belong to? I belong to First Free. First Free Church. Did you or your husband belong to any organizations like the singing groups? No. No? Only the church? Yeah. Holmström now, did he belong to any organizations because of insurance? Svea Söder. I don't know if I speak very good Swedish, but that's what it was. Svea Söder, ja. Svea Söder. Was he a singer? No, he wasn't a singer. He was not a singer? No. It was more of a... they had a singing society, but it was a social group, all of them. Because he had a lot of friends though he had to mingle with because of his insurance. He sure did. So he had to peddle his insurance business beside the mayoral duties. So he had another secretary down in City Hall then? Yes, he did have. So how was he as a debater in politics? Politics usually get dirty, they had to be arrogant and they had to push forward certain ideas. How was he then? No, I don't think he was ever arrogant. But they knew what he meant. Was he out speaking engagement before he was elected or did they just elected him on the name or his work? Well, that I don't recall. I don't remember that, no. Because there was probably other people running for office. It was before my time with MC. So you voted for him then? Definitely. Both your parents were born in Sweden? Yes, they were. Your father in Västmanland? Västmanland and Småland. Småland and Rydda Hall. Rydda Hall. I never did hear my father's birthplace. No. He never talked about that? No. He was just a Västmanlanding. That's what he said. There was no special place. And he was very strict. He was? My dad was very, very strict. He had seven children and he had to be. But there were six girls though. Six girls and one boy. They were not too naughty, the girls though. Did you spoil them? Oh, no, no, no. He never had any trouble with us. But he was the boss? He was the boss. How about your own legal status? He was the boss. How about your only brother now? Did you spoil him? Was he one of the middle or the? No, he was a fine young man. Of course, he got older. And he was a furniture salesman on the road. I see. How about your father? What kind of work was he doing? He was a hand carver. Hand carver. He learned a trade here in Rackforden. Evidently. Did they go back to Sweden at any time, your parents? Never. Never went back? They had too many kids. We were seven. But like your mother now, she mentioned she came from Rydaholm. Did she talk much about her home place in Småland? Not too much. Did she leave any sisters and brothers there when she came over? Well, I know she had a sister here and I think three brothers, as I recall it. I see. Did you visit Sweden at any time? No, not at any time. Never been there? No. You had no contacts with Sweden? No, not any. But you must have cousins over there or some relation, but you don't know anything else? Oh yeah, I have cousins. There was one that came to Rockford and he lived with my folks. And he's the only one I can think of. And his name was Elvar Peterson. Elvar Peterson. And he settled here in Rockford and married. Did he go back to Sweden again? He went back to Sweden. He went back to Sweden only to visit. Yeah. So you have seen Rockford growing then under Hallström, Mayoral ship. Yeah, that's right. And he built the Jefferson Bridge. Pardon? Do you remember when the Jefferson Bridge was built? Oh yes, I remember when that was built. They were standing there for a whole year, they didn't finish it. Do you remember what happened? What was the reason for it? No, I don't recall that. Did he discuss any politics with you, Hallström, when he came to office? No, not very much. No? No. He left the business end of it. And went to his business. Went to his business, yes. And took care of all of the insurance. And he had one daughter and a son? He had one daughter and one son, yes. And they are still living in Darling, Texas? Yeah. Do you have any contacts with them? Oh, well, just Christmas greetings and things like that. And occasionally Irene would write me a letter. And Roy had difficulty, he was very, very ill. He had a stroke? Similar to that. And they didn't have any children? No. Neither one was married? Roy had been married but was divorced. So Hallström, there is no Hallströms left, except... In Texas, those two would be living in Texas, Irene and Roy. But there are no relations up here in Rockport? Well, yes, I think that Irene would have, their name was Hammerstrand. What kind of relation was that? I think Mr. Hammerstrand was brother to Mrs. Hallström. So in your office now at the insurance company, you had the most modern equipment. At the time you had a Sundström airing machine and Underwood typewriters. Oh, yeah, I had all... I don't know how to say that typewriter. Smith Underwood? No. And you had a field? I forget the name of it. It was electric. How did it dictate the letters to you now? Did he write it all in longhand to you and you typed it off or did he talk to you over the... Well, you see, he would... I would know what had to be said. So you wrote the letters then? Yeah. He dictated. And you took a shorthand? Yes, yeah, I took a shorthand. So you had shorthand then in school? Oh, yes, I did. Yeah, but then you must have had a special course, though. They didn't teach shorthand in high school. Oh, yes, we did. They did? Oh, yeah. And typing? I took, I think, what's it, two years of shorthand. So he dictated the letters to you and you took it on and... In shorthand, yeah. And you typed it off and he signed them? That's right. Then you had to meet the public when they came in to the... That is correct. Did you take care of license plates and everything like to a notary public? Oh, if anyone came in, I could, sure. Where were you located in Rockford, down on 7th Street or Broadway? No, we ended up in the City Hall, in the new City Hall building. Oh, I see. He had an office there? Yeah. So he just had to walk across the hall? And on the City Hall building, City Hall building and then... Was there where he had his office? Yeah. And that was on the west side? No, east side. East side? Yes. There's the courthouses on the west side. That is correct. So then you had to meet Bargrain many times, the police chief. No, no, no, no. He didn't come into your office? No, no. And Police Constable Lindstrom? Oh, it had nothing to do with the police department. But I mean, you were swapping for the personal insurance business and so on? No, he didn't. He didn't believe in taking advantage of anybody that worked for him. Who? He, you know, he, to me, he was a wonderful man. He was very, very kind. He was very, extremely kind to me. And I have nothing but the best to say for him. How about, who were the policy holders? Now you had all kind of Italians and Irish. All kinds, yes. It was not only Swedes? No, oh no. Was it mostly Swedes, do you think? Well... You had a lot of Anderson and Lawson. And we had a lot of business firms, you know. Oh, big business. Big businesses and factories. Like National Lock, Republic Furniture. We didn't have anything with National Lock, but we did have other, we had other firms. For fire insurance and liability. And the casualty. And the casualty, yeah. So if something happened, then you had to pay out. If something happened, I mean... Or make up a report and send it in. How long did it take then? How long did it take then if a person had some casualty coming to him or her? Did it take several weeks or several months or... What do you mean? If they had some problems, I mean a fire, was it settled soon after? Oh, then they have, you know... You had adjusters? Adjusters, yes. Going on. The adjusting firm took care of that. We just took the report and sent the report to the adjusting office. End of interview.
