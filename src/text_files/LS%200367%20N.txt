 This is cassette 2, side 1, continuation with Henning Olsen, Moline, Illinois. Cassette 2, side 1. You were talking about this dam. Yeah, Fort Peck Dam. It was in that… When was it? 1933, I believe, or something like that. That's where Roosevelt was in. But there was the depression job to get people. Yes. And mostly… Were you in on that too? I did get in on it, but I had a couple of cousins that got in on it. That's my son, Mrs. Hargad's oldest son and daughter. They went up there to Fort Peck. After that got done, then they moved out to Vancouver, to Washington. Do you remember that? Did you visit that area when they were building it? Yeah. I was up there several times. It was a big job. Yes, a big job. A job for over 5,000 people. 5,000? Oh, yes. That was a huge affair. So they lived in barracks then? Yeah, they had barracks. And, of course, they got married then. And then, of course, they got little houses up there. So they could have the families with them? Yeah, they had families with them, I'd say. It was almost like a house. See there? Yes. Oh, that was… You could see their schools, their churches. That's right. That's right. And the saloons? Yeah. I didn't visit any saloons in Fort Peck, but… Yeah, that was a huge… It's quite a lake. How many years did it take now to build that one? Do you remember? No, I don't really remember, but… Because they started from scratch? Yes. Started from scratch. Oh, that must have been, took about four or five years, anyhow. They must have used up a lot of cement. Yes, and dirt. Well, dirt, too, because they had to fill it up. And they're still operating today? Oh, yes. Yes, that's a big project, I guess. So there was a necessity to get people to work? Then they went to work and built the Grad Gourley, out in Washington. Oh, that's bigger, I suppose. Yeah, I think so. So you were not exactly without a job then, during the Depression. You always… I don't know if you'd call it a job. A lot of times I just worked, and just to eat. To survive? Yeah, and I wasn't too worried about it. It was quite a deal, I tell you. Oh, it must be. But you got Montana in your blood? You bet. That's my home. And I love Montana. So now you're in Moline, Illinois? Yeah. You are not going to retire out there, though, after your wife is going to retire from her work? You're not planning to go west again? No, no. It's too late now, too. Yes. This was the end of interview with Henning Olsson, Moline, Illinois. End of interview. And it's the 13th of June, 1986.
