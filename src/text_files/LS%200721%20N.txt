 21st of July 1987, I'm sitting together with Ragnhild Svensson in Rockford, Illinois. And you were born 1904, 23rd of September, in Tidaholm. Yes. So, your parents now, there was Carl Johan Nilsson and Dorothea Victoria Nilsson. That's right. They lived right in Tidaholm. Yeah, yeah. You can speak Swedish, right? Yes. You can speak Swedish? Yes, a little. Swedish and American. Yes, yes, that's nothing. Dad, he works at the fire station. No, no, mom does. Mom works at the fire station. No, I don't know what he works with. It was... I don't know what kind of... He works with a little of everything. Yeah, I got a picture of him where he works. So he was a carpenter? Yeah, but that was him. That was not my father. I see, so it was another person. But dad worked on asphalt? Yes. There's a picture of that here. But he didn't work at the fire station? No, no. So it was a workshop dad worked in, at least. It wasn't a metal workshop or anything. No, I don't know. I don't think so. No? But the map has disappeared, that's where he worked. But mom now, she works at the fire station, at Vulkan. Yes, yes. Do you remember the factory or something? You were down there and... Right, right. Where we sit. When mom worked. What did she do? Packed firewood. In bags? Yes. And she worked all day with that? Yes, that's all I know. How many children were you in the family? Did you have time to work outside the home? We were five siblings. Five siblings? Gunnar, Gilbert, Mellie, me and Eleanor. Two boys and three girls? Yes. Was it any of the boys who worked at the factory? Yes. No one else but mom? Yes. I don't know much about... Did she tell you anything about a big fire at the factory once? I don't remember that. She didn't mention anything about that? No. So when you went to America, you were seven years old. Did the whole family go? Yes. Dad and my sister-in-law came a year before. To Rockford? Yes. In 1911 we came. Mrs. Gustafsson with three children and mom with three children. So you were in a company? Yes. Did you have any of your own share of the property when you went? It's rare to have that. Yes, but I don't remember. You don't remember? No. You were too young to remember. I remember when dad left. The three kids held on to him, didn't want him to go. But that's all I know. It was hard to get work in Sidaholm? Yes. There had been a strike a few years earlier? That's why we came. So there were many who... Many came, yes. So it wasn't hard to find comrades from Sidaholm in Rockford? No. We had a big... A picture of the whole bunch of them. There was a lot of them. It was over 20 men from Sidaholm. And my mother gave my father that for a birthday once. I wish I had it, but I don't know what's happened to it. It's gone. Yes. So do you remember when you packed bags and American boxes? No. You don't remember? No. You don't remember if you had anything special you didn't want to leave at home? No. And... My grandfather. He was still in Sidaholm? Yes, he came to the boat. He was crying. We had never seen him cry. Was it in Gothenburg? Yes, that's right. Gothenburg. How was the journey? Do you remember anything from Gothenburg to England? No. We were all sick. Not sure if you call it sick. Sick, yes. Except Elad and my mother. They weren't sick. Everyone was sick. All the others? Yes. So that's a bad memory of the journey. Were you sick in England when you went to the boat? Yes, when we came to the Atlantic. Then it got better? The bigger boat. And Franconia, that was a big boat? Yes, Franconia. Was it good with the space there, so you had your own cabin? Yes, we all stayed together. Your friends were also in Sidaholm? Yes, we all stayed together. So you had your own bathroom? No, I don't remember that. We were sick. We were sick, that's all. We couldn't eat. But the Atlantic got better? Yes. And how was New York when you came to Ellis Island? Yes, it was all over. But there were no problems on Ellis Island? No. You came through without any problems? Yes. Your father didn't meet you in New York? No, no, no. We were alone until we came to Rockford. And he was at the station and met you? Yes, on South Main Street. And your other father met you? Yes, they were together. Did he have a house in Ordningställ before? Yes, we came to Ernst Hammerstrand. He was one of the Sidaholmers. And you lived with him? Yes, they had a house on Rural Street. Hammerstrand? No, Hammerstrand lived on... I forget. We came to Hammerstrand first. And from there we came to Rural Street. And you lived there for a while? Yes, probably a year or so. And then we moved from one place to another. So Rural Street was out on the countryside at that time? Yes, yes. There were cows and dogs? No, no. Rural Street? No, no. Was it a city? No, it was between two cemeteries. Scandinavian cemeteries? Yes, yes. So it was out there? Yes, Greenwood and... But no houses in the far east and north? No, no. It was an open country? Yes, yes. So you lived there for a while? What did your father do here in Rackford? He worked at a desk. Rackford desk? Desk. For furniture? Yes, for furniture. Your mother didn't work? No, my mother didn't work. She stayed at home? Yes, at that time. She stayed at home. She stayed at home, yes. And your older brothers, did they go to school? Yes, yes. We started school together. Yes, there it is. And you started school too? Yes. How did that go? I never went to school in Sweden. Because they go to school there for seven years. I didn't go because we were going to America. But how did it go? You didn't know any English when you came here? Yes, yes. Well, there were other children, you know. So you helped and played? We helped, yes. You helped in English? But at home with mom and dad you had to speak Swedish? Yes, yes. Dad went to... Night school? School, yes. Mom didn't have time for that, so she read... The newspapers. Yes, but they were Swedish newspapers. Yes, yes. So she didn't learn much English? No, she didn't have time. She was 36 years old, so she didn't go here. What was the reason for her death? They had a Swedish nurse here. She had... Eleanor, the youngest girl, she got long-term inflammation and pneumonia. She died of pneumonia. She had a guider. And... That took her. So she died when she was 36 years old? So she didn't go home for six years? I was only 14 years old. I was the oldest. So you had to take care of the house? Yes. So you had to quit school? No, no. They let me stay in school and finish the eighth grade. And then my sister was only five years old. They let her come to school with me and sit and take what she wanted. You don't start school until you're six years old, you know. But she followed you? Yes. How old was she? Five years old. And she followed you to school? Yes. So I could finish school. So you knew English? Oh yeah. No difficulties at all? No, no, no. But you came home and stayed with your father and the other children? Yes. And you were a housewife when you were 14 years old? Yes. How did that work? Could you go out and buy... My mother prepared me. You could bake and everything? Yeah, yeah. But it was a responsibility for you to be home alone? Yeah, yeah. Well, I went to... I didn't go to high school, but I went to business college to learn to be a secretary, you know. My father wanted to give me a chance to do something, you know. And so I went for six weeks is all I got, you know, of that. And then I had to stay home and take care of the kids because they got too much. And that's it. So it was a big responsibility on your shoulders? Uh-huh, uh-huh. How long did you stay at home with your father? Let me see. Nineteen hundred and... Twenty-five. Nineteen, twenty-five. How old were you then? Twenty-one, I think. Twenty-one. Your father didn't get married? No, no. And no house? No. But then the other siblings started to get older? Yeah, yeah, yeah. They got older, and the boys got older. So in 1921 you moved from... Or, 25? Yeah, yeah, yeah. Did you work at a restaurant then? Huh? Did you work at a restaurant then? Yeah, yeah, yeah. And then you bought a new hat and new shoes? Yeah, yeah, yeah. High heels, shoes, everything. You look like a prima donna here on the map. It was in Rackford? Yeah. No, the restaurant. You could almost think it was Greta Garbo. Yeah, yeah. What is that? Is that a fox fur that hangs on your armpits? Yeah, it's a scarf. So that was fashion at that time? Yeah, yeah. Most girls were... So you were done, you were going to dance. Yeah, but I didn't go to no dances. I didn't have no time for that. Not at all? No. Which church did you belong to? Yeah, yeah, Sion Church. In April I was confirmed in Sion Church. My mother died in October. That's probably my father's, I guess. Yeah, your father. He worked for the Free Sewing Machine, so that's where I'm from. Which year did he die? 1949? Yeah, yeah. It says he was born in Västergötland. When he died, all the children were raised and married? Yeah, he lived with his mother. So your younger sister? Yeah, that's the way he looked, to the last. Did he have the opportunity to return to Sweden? No. He never went back to Stockholm? No. None of you have gone back? No, no. 1918, second 1918. That was my father. My mother lived here. That was 1917. This is Ilof, Halvar, Lillie and Lisa. Gustafsson's. So you were very close to Gustafsson's. Did you live in the same neighborhood as them in Tidaholm? Yes. And that was also your neighborhood? We were relatives. So you were close relatives. You were close relatives in Rackfjord? You were together often? Yes. Who took all these pictures? Who took the pictures? I don't know. Who had the camera in the family? I don't know. This is a big group in Tidaholm? No, no, no. This is the Tabor-Luton church. What is that? This is the Tabor-Luton church. And those are our neighbors. Hofstedts and Wetterströms. Did your father have a spice business? Your father? Was he your husband? No, no, no. Who had the business? Yeah, yeah, he had the Parker's. This is Nelson's Grocery here? Yeah, Nelson's Grocery. That's my father's. That's your father's business? How many years did he have it? On Broadway. 2006 Broadway. 2006 Broadway. How many years did he do business? About three, four years I guess. And then he got the job back in the factory. At the free sewing machine? So it was safe then? So did you help out in the business with your father? Yeah, yeah. So what kind of work did you get during the Depression? Was it hard? No, no, no. He had a job. He had an oil truck. That is my husband. So you were married? Yeah, yeah. 1925. 1925? Yeah. See, that's when I left the family. How do you meet your husband now? Well, he comes to the store. He comes to the store and I waited on him. And his folks lived in our house when we moved out of our house. So I knew him. And he came to Husqvarna? He came to Fynsfärje later than... No, about the same time. A year different I think. As far as I know. So I didn't know him from Sweden or anything. So when you met in the store, did you speak Swedish to each other? No, I don't think so. No, when mother died, dad just talked English to us and stayed with us. He wanted us to be Americanized, you know. Yeah, yeah. So that's why I can't talk good Swedish. So you learned it from the beginning in English. Yes, yeah. You remember some words. Yeah. But there were a lot of people coming in to the store who spoke Swedish? Yeah, yeah. Oh yeah. From 7th Street and Broadway. Yeah, yeah. See, we made pickled herring, you see. Herring in the store? Yeah, and the Swedes come from all over. Yeah. Because we made a lot of them. But when the old Swedes came, you had to speak Swedish? Oh yeah, well, as good as we could. They felt better at home ordering pickled herring, herring, and lingonberries. Oh yeah. You sold that too? Yeah. From the Swedish produce from Chicago. We had an agent come and sold us all of it. Yeah. We had regular barrels of lingonberries by Christmas, you know. Just like they come. I picked lingons in the... Oh. Where did my father and grandmother live? Daltorp. It makes me mad. I can't remember. Ihabo. Yeah, that ain't the name of it. Ekåsen. That's my father. I lived there for a little while, for heaven's sakes. And with grandmother? Yeah. And grandfather? Uh-huh. And you picked lingons? We picked lingons and blueberries. And we fished... Crabs too? Uh... Oh, I know just as well as anything. In Vättern. Oh, near Vättern? Uh-huh. Abborre? Abborre, yeah. Is that perch? Yeah. That's what it was. So, that's what you caught. But you never saw grandmother or grandfather? I don't remember what they looked like. I know what their name is, but I don't know what they looked like. So, your husband, he got a job during the Depression? Yeah. So, it wasn't hard for you? No. And you didn't work either? No. You stayed home? Uh-huh. And took care of the house? Uh-huh. Did you go to any clubs, you and your husband? In Vasa? Yeah, Lyran. Lyran? Uh-huh. The singing club? Uh-huh. Where he sang, maybe? Wow. When he was little, he sang in a soprano voice. He was just a young kid with a soprano voice, you know. And when he changed his voice, his mother let him sing, and that was the wrong thing to do, see. So, he ruined his voice? Yeah, she should have. Uh-huh. And from then on, he didn't sing anymore. But you listened to Lyran? Yeah. How about the Temperance? I did for a while. It was for Rockford Lodge on 3rd Avenue. And there's where I worked. That was the restaurant, you know, up there. And on the second floor? Upstairs. Upstairs, yeah. Uh-huh. Oh, yeah. And for a while. And then I got married, and I didn't have no chance to go anyplace. So, they don't take care of the kids. So, that restaurant on Rockford Lodge, that belongs to the Lodge? No. No, it didn't belong to it, no. There was no co-op? There was, in Vega, they had that. It was a co-operation. Wasn't it Carl Lindy who owned that restaurant? No. No, Carl Lindy is for Vega. For Vega, yeah. Uh-huh. No, this was a Higmano. Oh, there was a private? Yeah. Private restaurant? Yeah. No, the people owned it, you see. It was a, what do you call it? A co-op. Yeah, that's what it was, co-op. See, you had students and... Yeah, yeah, yeah. But didn't Carl Lindy work for that, too, though? Maybe he did. I don't remember him. But I know him, I know him. There you worked in a couple of years? Yeah, yeah. Uh-huh. Yeah, until they quit. Closed it up? Yeah. And it was the hard times that made it... that they closed the doors, of course. People didn't have money and... Dad never talks about going back to Sweden? Uh-uh. Well, I suppose he would have, but I don't think he had money enough to... To go. Go. Have you visited Sweden after that? I have never either. No one? I just dream about it. Do you have any friends left in Tidaholm that you could visit? Yeah. Cousins? Yeah, yeah, I got a lot of cousins, but they wouldn't remember me. They were... They were young. There was two older ones, that was Ruth and me, and that was my mother's brother's daughter and me. We were the oldest ones. And the others, they don't remember. They were too young. That's it. Have they visited you over here? No, no. No one? No one. Have you corresponded with them over here? I have for a while, and then they quit all of a sudden. They did? Yeah. How about now where your mother lived, or she corresponded? Oh, yeah, oh, yeah, sure. Yeah, and my father, too. So he wrote back? Yes, uh-huh, yeah. But then it stopped? Then it stopped, yeah. So I never heard when the old folks died or anything. Nothing at all. Your father and mother, did they have any sisters and brothers over here? They were the only ones? No, no, no, they were the only ones. From their family? No, I've got pictures of them there, that's all, but they never come here. But you had this book here now, Alma Nack, for 1909. There you have written, and your father's birthday and date and where he was born, and your mother's, and your siblings. Who wrote this down? Was it your mother who wrote this down, or who wrote this? Hans Gunnar Bertil, born 1907. That's my mother. In Sogardreven 5. Sogardreven. Sogardreven. Where did you take it? Outside, I think. I don't know. I don't know where it is. And then we have Mildred Nelson, born 7 March 1913. That's my father. Who wrote that. And he wrote this? Uh-huh. And then Carl Olof Gilbert, born 1909, in Tidaholm. Öde, what do you mean? Östra? Öde, Östra, part 25, I think. Öde 25, Tidaholm. Yeah. And he died in 1972, 63 years old. He fell off a roof. He was fixing his antenna, and he fell off the roof and died from the injuries. And he was a plowman too. And Ellen O'Nelson, she was born 1918. That was in connection with my mother when she died. She was only six weeks old. And Ragnhild Margit Elisabeth, born 1904, in Sogardreven, Tidaholm. And my father, Carl Johan Nilsson, born 23 September 1880. 27th, right? 28th, maybe. 27th, September. In Ekeåsen, Daretal. And he died 67 years old in 1949. So my father started writing, and you finished. When they died. Your husband, he was a plowman after a while. What's that? Thinsmith. Yeah, yeah. How did he get into that job? Let me see. Well, he belonged to Liron, and that was next door to Liron. So that's how he got in that. Mr. Parker got him into that, the owner, you know. So he taught him how to do it. And then your sons continue with your husband then. Yeah, yeah. To learn the trade. And they are still in the business. Yeah, the youngest one, the middle son, moved to Colorado. He's not doing this kind of work, he's doing... construction work. Construction. Yeah, that's what he's doing. So your oldest son, then, he is a sheet metal. The oldest son was killed in the war. Oh, I see. In Japan. The Tanakazi shot his boat down. He was 17 years old. He was only a kid. And your other sons, they were too young then to be driven. Yeah, well, the middle one went in when he heard what happened to Bob. He went in and said, I'm going to kill every Jap there is. But that ain't the way it turned out. But he came back to Wisconsin. Yeah, yes. He got a good job and everything in the Navy. I'll tell you, war is hell. So that was a hard blow for the family of... Yes, it was. The next son, then, he is the one that has the sheet metal. The youngest one. He's got the sheet metal here. Oh, the youngest one. So he stayed with it. His name is Gilbert. Gilbert, too. Gilbert Swenson. And you still have a sister here in Oxford. Yeah, yeah. On Ohio Parkway up here. I see her quite often. And I told her about you, too, and I said, would you like me to have him come up or you come down here and meet you, too? She would love that because she's having clubs. She's having women's clubs. She belongs to organizations. Well, she has card parties, or what they call them, once in a while. I just happened to come on that day. And you don't belong to those clubs? No, not anymore. I don't. You take care of your garden? Yeah, yeah, yeah. That's my life. You take care of yourself completely? All of this, yeah. You have no help? Yeah, he cuts the grass and things like that, but everything is growing. Me and the birds do all the planting there. All them. But here we have over 95 degrees today. We had a whole week with over 90s. Uh-huh. And you are out here. Sure. Yeah. I think you get the sunstroke, though. I get the fresh air. That's all I need. Fresh air? Yeah. The heat doesn't bother you? No, no. No, I have to keep busy. You know, I can't sit down and I got to keep busy. Yeah, but people are worn for sunstrokes and not being out in the sun too much. No, I don't stay in the sun. I stay in the shade. And you don't have a hat on or anything. Yeah, I got a half a dozen hats in there. But you never use them, though? No, no. So the heat never bother you then? No. Not at any time? No. Well, yeah, if I'm in the house and if I don't have no cooling. Ragnhild declared the heat off. It's at least 40 degrees here in the sun. But my tape recorder was out of order. We'll try again. This is the second part of the interview with Ragnhild Svensson, Rackford, Illinois. Now we have it above 95 degrees and it's been over 90 degrees for a couple of weeks. Yeah. And you are out here weeding and bending. Not every day, no. But you're out today, though? Oh, yeah. And no hat on? No. How can you muster this heat? I mean, you're afraid of sunstroke? No, I'm not. You never have any trouble with the heat? Uh-uh. No, I get sunburned, but then you get over that. Yeah, but not a warning for too much sun. Yeah, yeah. But you never had any problem? No. So you like to be out there, but you mentioned the birds are helping you. Yeah, they're here all the time. See, they're here all the time. Sure. I got a red bird, too. It's a friend of mine. Do they know you? Yeah. He sits on the fence there when I'm washing dishes. He sits on the fence there, and then I says, Do you want some seeds? Sure. I go out in the garage there, put some seeds in there, and I sit down here and watch him. Here he comes down. What kind of bird is that, the other one? It's a canary. Canary. A wild one? Yeah, a wild canary. Somebody got off them from somewhere. Well, there was one in the neighborhood that did come out, and I called him Charlie, and they were sitting here. And then the girl next door says, Why don't you call him Charlie, and he'd come to you. I says, Gee, I didn't know anybody had a – So here he is. Yeah. I don't know if that's him or not. It might be a wild canary. But you provide water and everything for him when he's hot? Yeah, two times a day. Two times a day? Mm-hmm. Yeah, the man next door says, Oh, let him fly down to the river and back again and get a drink of water and take a bath. I says, Oh. So you like the outdoors? Yeah, I do. Did you do that in younger days too? I mean, you have a tent sleeping on the river and – Oh, yeah, once in a while, yeah, for vacation. Because years ago you could do that. How about today, though, sleeping in a tent outside? No, no, no, no, no. I don't even dare to sleep on the front porch. No, it's so much bad stuff going around nowadays. The time has changed. Yes, it has very much. You know, when my boys were small, they used to sleep on the front porch. It wasn't closed in. They'd sleep on the front porch in the summertime. But not anymore. Oh, not now, no. Things have changed. That's all right. I come across – do you remember Bronstorp? Bronstorp. Yeah. There's where my grandma and grandpa lived. Oh, I see, Bronstorp. There where they lived. Uh-huh. Yeah, and Gustafsson's lived in – Begins with B2, what was it? I forgot it. This is my father's relatives. Does it say there at all? In Doretorp. Is that what it is? Yeah, it's taken. Now, where is all this? Oh, you mean they also came to the United States? No. Does it say there? Nobody says – Uh-uh. Irma North Dakota, USA. I don't even know. North Dakota, USA. Oh, my goodness. And that's the same address then? Yeah. So when you left then, you received this as a gift? My mother did, yeah. A wooden box. Yes. And – Memory of the friend Gerda. And her husband made this, and he made it out of cigar boxes. Every one of them is part of a cigar box. I see. It was real. Memory of the friend Gerda Tidaholm, the first of June, 1911. And that's where you went? Uh-huh. The first of June, 1911. Uh-huh. And then we came to America in midsummer. So it was July 20th, midsummer. Yes, that's June 24th. July. June. Oh, is it? Yes. Oh! So that was probably the right time. Uh-huh. Now, well, yeah. How about Christmas now? When your mother died, it was up to you then to get in the Christmas tree and dress it and so on. Did you do that? Oh, yeah. We always did, yeah. You had a Christmas tree? We always went to Gustafsson's or Beckman's. For Christmas parties? Yeah, yeah. But did you have your own Christmas tree? We had our own, yeah. With light candles? Yeah, yeah. Yeah. But the Jultomten, the Christmas, what do you call it, Santa Claus, did he come? Oh, yeah. Uh-huh. When we lived on 13th Avenue. Well, I was less than 14 years then, so I must have been 12. I was 12 years old. It was not easy for you to take care of all those things. No, well. Did they do that? Oh, yeah. We all helped. Uh-huh. How were you able not to keep your sisters and brothers under your supervision? Did you have to spank them or? Oh, no, no, no, no. They obeyed? Oh, yeah. We were all together. My brother, my older brother and me, we all worked together. It was wonderful. And God kept us well and happy. So you didn't have any problems, though? No, no, no, never. And the younger brother, he was funny, you know. Oh, I don't know what they call it. It isn't funny exactly, but he was humorous, you know. Oh, comical. Yeah, comical. And he kept us in stitches. Anybody, you know, feel bad or something, he'd get you right out of it. I see. No, we were all together. Everybody helped. It was wonderful. He was something like Carl Bruston. Ah, I don't know him very well. Was he a comical? Yes, yes, yeah, he was comic, that's right. Yeah. So did you attend those meetings now with Dr. Lodge? Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. And they used to have Swedish, what do you call it? Theatrical plays? Theatricals. We went to every one of them. And Swedish movies, they used to have Swedish movies quite a bit in town. What did they show later on at the movie house? No, a family theater on Broadway. It isn't there no more. They used to have it there. And they had a Svea Hall, too. And there were Swedish films there? Swedish, yeah. And people used to come over from Sweden, like Bergslogsmoor. They used to come from Sweden and put on skits here. Entertain? Yes. Edvard Persson? Yeah. You remember him? Oh, yeah, he was funny. Skåning. Skåning, but that was later in the 40s, though. Yes, yes, it was. It was after the Depression. Yeah. But during the Depression, there was a lot of hard times, though, for people. It was for people, yes. They lost their houses. Anybody that had any kind of a job was lucky. And some lost their money in the bank. Yeah, that's right. Oh, yeah. You didn't have anything in your... No, very little, just what the kids had in their savings, you know, that they got from... They saved in the school? Yeah, yeah. They lost that? Yeah. But didn't they feel bitter about the... I don't... There was a different feeling. You came over it. Uh-huh. You've got to see what's going on. So you don't miss anything about this hedgerow of sunflowers? Uh-uh. Violets? Yeah, they come up on themselves. Oh, I wish I had a picture of the violets. In the... Yeah, it's really... They come up on themselves. Yeah, I don't... And there you have the pear tree. Uh-huh. It's been here ever since we moved here. We moved here in 19... How long did you live here? 1929. The same house, then? See, there's my red bird. See? Yeah. There he is. Beautiful. Huh. Yeah, we're the only one that lived here. It wasn't meant to be. So your husband, did he build it then or did he buy it? Yeah, we bought it. It was already built? Yeah, yeah, yeah. Uh-huh. You couldn't get houses at that time. There was none to be gotten. And he went around and happened to see this man. He was a bachelor. He lived here. He built the two houses there. And he had to go to Medford, Oregon for his health. So that was for sale. And we paid $4,900 for it at the time. And you were still here? And we borrowed $500... $250 from my dad and $250 for somebody else. And that was a down payment. That was the story. Where does $500 go nowadays? So that's it. And we paid $35 a month like rent, only you get to keep it, you know. How about the spruce trees? Did your husband plant those? The what? The spruce? No, no, no. They were not here, though? No, they were not here. But the people next door, I took care of their animals. See, they had chickens and they had dogs and all kinds of animals. I took care of them. And they went up north and they brought me them, that big. From Wisconsin? Yes. Uh-huh. They were bigger than that. You didn't have any chickens, though, when you came here? No. Yeah, we did. The man had chickens here, but we didn't keep them long. Yeah. But the pear tree is the same one? That's the same one. Uh-huh.
