 Yeah, it's 27th of October 1986 and I'm sitting together with Aurelia Anderson, Rockford, Illinois. She was born 1892, 9th of December in Rockford, Illinois. So your parents now, Joseph Lundquist and Annette Lundquist, they came from Sweden. And it was in the late 1880s. Your mother came, your mother was born in Sweden? She was born in 1870 in Sweden. And came to the United States when she was 16 years old in 1886. Did she come with her parents or she came alone? She came with the rest of the family. Two of them were already here, the oldest ones. They were graduates of a college in, well, it's small in some places. I forgot where it was now. I see. So the whole family came over? Well, those two were here first and then the rest came over later. There were seven, nine children. And two, the oldest two graduated from a college over there and they came over here first and went to Chicago and got work in Chicago. And then the rest followed in the... Seven children and the parents? Seven children and the parents came in one bunch? Yeah, they came. It was not easy to move the whole family like that. But the two oldest ones were already here. What kind of work was her dad doing in Sweden? What kind of work? Well, the oldest one got work in a factory in Chicago where they made vests. And then when she met somebody and she got married, she married a man that had an editor of something, a Swedish... I don't know if it was Svenska Nyheter or Rökkakos Posten, one of those Swedish papers. He was the editor. She met him and married him. What was his name? Do you remember his name? He had... Højstein, Højstein, it's American, Højstein, it's S-J-O-S-T-E-N. Oh, Højstein. Højstein, yeah. So she married him. How about your grandpa on your mother's side, morfar? What kind of work was he doing in Sweden before he left? Well, he had a store. In Oskarshamn? Had a grocery store. And when other people that couldn't pay their bills, they would give furniture or something, whatever piece of stuff they had, they paid with. So when he left Sweden to go to the United States, he had an attic, a store and an attic full of stuff that he had to get rid of. So that was his payment? On Sundays he used to, sometimes he would preach a different Baptist, the different small churches that didn't have regular ministers. He'd be preaching in different places. Oh, I see. So he was a... He was a Baptist. A Baptist. The whole family? The whole family? The whole family were Baptists. I see. So did they tell you anything about the travel over now? Did they go to England first and then over to the United States? About what? How they traveled over here by boat. Did your mother tell you anything about that trip? Well, I have a... My aunt made an afternoon on the trip from Sweden to Rockford. Oh. All right. So why don't you read this? Okay, I'm reading the letter. I'll tell you later. I'm reading it. I'm reading it.

So it was not easy for your dad to start up a new life here, and also your mother, I think, that came together with her family. They were not easy for them in the beginning, I suppose. No. How did they learn how to talk? I think my mother could talk a little bit. She had learned over in Sweden. In Sweden? Mm-hmm. You think so? Well, she was a young girl when I was a little baby in school over there. They were teaching it, maybe. Well, they got to be especially good, or I wouldn't get anything. They never complained. Because they lived in Chicago, and Marshall Fields was in there at that time, too. Because you talk about going to Marshall Fields with somebody, and they wanted my mother to be a model, a model from the clothes there. And my mother was very good-looking, but my mother didn't want the job. That's why she was living in Chicago. Then when this aunt of mine moved out here and got married to a man named Costelli, then my mother came out here to visit and was staying with them, and that's where she met my dad. He was, there was a mother from Sweden, some woman, and she wanted all the information she could get. So that's why he wrote, got in touch with my cousin in California, and she referred him to me. So I gave him all the information I had about my grandmother and grandfather and all the information I had, and I must have sent him there because she was, this woman was anxious for everything. She wanted everything in the original if she could get it, you know. So I gave him all the information I had. I wrote him a long letter. He's dead now, so. Do you have contacts with Sweden? Do you write to Sweden? No, I don't. No one that you know of now? This was a woman that my, I think he must have met her in church or something, my cousin in Donahue, at south of Los Angeles, and got acquainted with her there. She was in Sweden trying to get information, I guess, and to take back to Sweden. So I gave him what information I had, pictures that I made copies of, like you see over here. I made copies of them in the stores where they have those machines. So you haven't had contact with Sweden then for many years? How about your mother now? When did she die? Your father died in 1930. My mother died in 1963. 1963? She was very old then. She died in March, and if she'd lived to March 18, if she'd lived two months longer to May 19, she would be 93. She was in pretty good health? Yeah. Before she died, she wasn't very well, but she was in good health before then. She was sick for a while before she died. She died in that room there. I had a bed, made a regular bedroom out of that room. I think you helped, after my brother died, you helped take out the bed that they had for Herbert. We had the same bed down there for my mother and my sister, and my dad died in there too. My dad died there, my mother died there, and my sister almost died. She went to the hospital and she died there. She'd been there a few days, so she died almost in there too. So I made a bed. I had a room come in here for a bedroom, you know. And then I had chest of drawers I put down here, and the piano we put there. And then the dining room. So you had taken care of all of your family then, your father and mother and... Sister and brother. Sister and brother. They all died in there, except my sister. I couldn't take care of the last... The doctor said she'd go to the hospital, and I said, well, let her stay a few days longer and we'll see how I get along. And I slept down here in the damn port. I had to stay up late all night because she did things she shouldn't do. And so I told her, I said, well, maybe she better go there for a couple of days. And she was only there a few days and she died in the hospital. So she was here practically the whole time she was sick. And she had children. Your husband, when did he die? He died in 1965. June 1965. When was he born? He was born in, let's see, about 1991. He was about a year older than me. December 91. In December? No, December. Yeah, December.
