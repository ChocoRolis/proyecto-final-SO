 They get an idea and the stick to that. They do not go through the whole Bible. But Billy Graham, he has the Bible all the time and he turns the pages and he reads right from it. Sure, he can read scripture, so can I. But just because you read a scripture does not necessarily mean they're telling you the truth. They can twist them too. But you can follow it in the Bible yourself. Sure, sure. You can twist it to give the wrong meaning to it. For instance, here, like the war. Now we got a president that's interested in Star Wars. Okay. Now, this is what the Bible says, what God is going to do. It says, he's making wars to cease to the extremity of the earth. The bow he breaks apart and thus cut the spear in pieces. The wagons he burns in the fire. God is going to destroy all this war material that you have. You see, because prophecies are going to take seven years to clean up. Because remember, you were created to live. You were not created to die. But still so many religions have died. Yeah, well, sure we are dying due to Adam's disobedience. We're dying, yes. How long is it going to continue? Does your religion teach anything about that? Well, there is a sign coming now. I couldn't tell you. It says, for when they shall say peace and safety, then sudden destruction will come upon them. As travel on a woman with child and shall not escape. That's the sign. And the first thing you're going to see is this organized religion going down. Every one of them is going to be destroyed. Because it's a... Here is the point what it teaches you, see. They teach you that you have a soul. So when you die, your soul leaves your body, see. It either goes down to hell, a burning hell. There is no scripture to prove that God ever created such a place. They were Lutheran, you know. Lutheran and the rest of them do too. Either that or you go down there, you go to heaven. The Bible doesn't teach either one of them. But how can they make up things like that? Well, here, it used to show you. Now you can take any Bible you want. Now, if you can prove that this scripture says that you were created with a soul, it says, and Jehovah God proceeded to form the man out of the dust from the ground and to blow into his nostrils the breath of life and the man came to be a living soul. You can take any Bible you want, it'll tell you the same thing. Genesis 2, 7. You are a soul. You do not possess a soul, see. You are a living soul. Animals are souls. Fishes are souls. See. There is where the teaching comes in. That's how they can sway the people any way they want, see. It's true that false impression. Do you have any exchange of pulpits with other churches? We have people coming from out of the land, you mean? No, no, no. No? No. What do we want them for? Well, you know, nowadays they have done that. Yeah, no, no, not we. The new churches go through the covenant, the baptism. Yeah, no. It was possible years ago. We know this is... But you don't have that. The main fundamental teaching is the same in all of them, see. So in other words, you don't compromise on your teaching. Nope. We will not compromise on it. So what do they say, though? Like the Pentecostal, what do you call them? Assembly of God. Well, that's the Pentecostal. Yeah, that's Pentecostal. What do they say? I mean, they are very outspoken. They speak in tongues. Oh, yeah. Well, do they get that authority to speak in tongues? That was done away with. The Bible says it was done away with. It says it in the Bible? Yeah. Oh, but they have a whole... Oh, sure....nomination on that now. True to heaven. See? There stands somebody, generally, mostly a woman, see. She blabbles something that nobody understands. Nobody understands, see? So the preacher, he stands up there, interprets this. He doesn't know either, but he tells them what he does. See? That's how they fool the people. Well, why is it like that? You see, the Catholics, they never understood the sermon, you know, for thousands and thousands of years. You know, they couldn't read the Bible. Yeah. See? Well, they don't care. They like that. How can they like the idea, you know, and not question anything? Well, but you see... And now you have the Pentecostals. They are reading, speaking in tongues. Nobody understands what they're saying. And still, they are building more churches and... Oh, yeah....and more churches. And they are building more churches. And they are building more churches. And they are building more churches. And they are building more churches. And still, they are building more churches and... Oh, sure....people are flocking to them. True. They have a good way of begging for money. You see, we never beg for money. You can go into our meeting. I know that. I know that. Oh, you know. It's like Herbert W. Armstrong. He never begged for money either. Yeah, but he got it, though. Yeah. But he never begged for money. No. No, he didn't. He says, you send in your name. See, that's how they got your name, see? You know, because they got it. And they got it. And they got it. And they got it. And they got it. And, of course, from then on, you got... Then you got letters. He never begged for money over there, though. No, not over there, no. No. No. That's true. I agree with you there. And he prints this magazine, Living Truth... Living Truth, somewhere....Living Truth magazine. In so many different languages. All over the world. So he's got your name, and then you got your name on the mailing list. So then you get some letters. So what do you think about his preaching or his teaching? I think he's teaching a lot of people. I think he's teaching a lot of people. He's teaching a lot of people. He's teaching a lot of people. He's teaching a lot of people. And he's teaching a lot of people. And he's teaching a lot of people, and you get some letters. So what do you think about his preaching? He's dead now. But, I mean, what do you... If you compare it to yours... Well, there are certain things that are similar, see? Yes, but what is... But there's lots of things that is not, see? About life and death, for instance, what... I really don't know just what his theory is on life and death. But I couldn't say if he believes... I think he believes in the mortal soul. I think he does. I'm not positive, so I don't want to... I don't want to say, see? He has a son in Texas that started his own religion, I understand. He was disfellowshipped. I don't know why. He must have done something, so... He was all stood, I understand. He was all stood by his father, I understand. He must have done... But he's still going? Yeah, he's going, yeah. Oh, yeah, so is the Armstrong church. So is Dr. Schuller and Jimmy Swigert? Oh, yeah, sure. As long as they get the money, they're going to go. Do you think people really believe that, though, if they pay them enough money, they will be saved? I imagine. Otherwise, they wouldn't do it, would they? Otherwise, they wouldn't do it, would they? Because even young people are doing it. Yeah, I imagine. I imagine. I imagine. I imagine. I imagine. I imagine. I imagine. I imagine. I imagine. I imagine. I imagine. I imagine. I imagine. I imagine. I imagine. I imagine. I imagine. It's not only old timers. Very few young ones are singing in Czechs. No, I never... So that's... That's been your faith then since 1933? Mm-hmm. How did... What really happened? Only by reading? Yeah, I just... Somebody... I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. So I was talking to a fellow, see. Actually I was a guy that didn't believe in heaven or hell. I says, it's not in the book. Before 13? Yeah. So he asked me, he says, I got a book that I want you to read. Now he was not a Jehovah's Witness, see. He says, you take it home and read it and see what you think of it, and give it back to me. So I read it. That sounds sensible. In other words, it made sense. So I began to look into further meetings. So you joined the local church then? Yes, I have been one ever since. And all the members are active? Yes, they are all active. So you are not only on the roster or in the membership list? Really, we don't have no members. There are no members to it. But you have to have a mailing list to send out to people. They got to know who you are. Well, we know who they are. We don't have no mailing list. So it's an organization. No membership still is going, spreading all over. In 208 lands. So no matter where you go, you'll find them. You have one church on Elbein? Yes. And one in Belvedere? One in Belvedere. We have one on Oxtenton. And one in Belvedere. One in Belvedere. We have one on Oak Street. There's two churches in Rockport? We got one on Elm Street. Three Elm? And we got one up on North Central. And one in Loves Park. So you go together and have discussions. How did you come together? Once every six months, we get together. That's all. And the pastor, do you call him a pastor? No, no. We don't have a pastor. No clergy? No clergy. So who is running the thing, in other words, in charge of it? Well, that is what they call the elders. And it can be one like you? Yeah. There's not one higher professional? No, no. Nobody's higher. Nobody's getting any money. So what you do, that's all voluntary work. So you are out there most of the days in the week? Every day. How are you received now by people when you knock on the door? Not, you know... Are people... They are indifferent. They got their own religion. And as a follow, they are not interested. They don't discuss it any time with you? No, they don't. Very few. Very few. There are some that will, but not very few. It isn't like it used to be. It was better years ago? People had time to listen? Yeah, well, evidently, to listen. But you go to other countries like Mexico or South America, or they just... They are more open? Yeah, they're actually flocking in. Many countries. So you think people here are confused? Well, they belong to all these different religions, you see. And so they... Well, we got our own church, and so that's it. That's the opinion. There's nothing you can do about it, is there? You can't go and... If they, you know, want to talk, so you can talk to them, and you can talk to them. The Mormons, they are also knocking on doors? Oh, yeah. That's two of them. They're always two together, see? They worked there for two years, see? That's all. But they work in a different approach, so they push a little bit more, don't they? Yeah, I think so. I think so. And they say they are getting membership? Oh, yeah. Sure, they are. But their religion is very strange, though. I mean, it's something else. Yeah, I don't understand how people can believe that. But they do. They do. Yeah. How about... You don't have any baptism in your church? Infant baptism? No, no, no. No baptism whatsoever? No. And no confirmation? No confirmation, no. How about marriage now and death? Do you perform that in your church? We can perform in church, yeah. Oh, yes. You can do that? Oh, yeah. And funerals and so on? Yes. And that's one of the elders then that takes care of that? Oh. Do you have a special funeral home that you go to then? No, no. Whatever funeral home it is. Any one of them can do that? Sure. There's no... We don't charge for it. And it's free. I understand somebody's charging $25. Because we had somebody that died and the funeral director gave up the... Well, then you got $25 for the minister. No, he says Jehovah's Witness is going to preach the funeral, so there are going to be no... No, that's free service. So you give service to the people. How about visiting old timers now in the home? Do you have challenge too? I mean, do you visit for... No, we don't have any. Somebody, we find out they go... that's in the hospital, we go and visit them. Oh, yeah, sure. So they can call on you and... Sure. How about when the young people have difficulties in their marriage? Can you get the counseling service? Yeah, well, if they come to us and talk about it, and we try to get them together and show them the scripture, prove how they should live together, the man is the head of the house. That doesn't mean that he's going to clobber to death or anything like that, but... But you give counseling then? Yeah. So it's up to them then from then on. You don't call in an outsider, I mean, to lead your church or... No. You keep it local? It's local. And you don't, you're not under one jurisdiction, I mean, you have to play under Chicago or Texas or anything similar? No. You are all local? We're local. Everything is local. The Lutherans, you know, they have what they call Lutheran mission, or African mission, and black mission, all kinds of different things. Oh, the Sand Missionaries? Yeah. Yeah, well, we do, we have Sand Missionaries. In South America? South America and Africa, over the South Sea Islands, West Indies, we got them all over, yes. And your son? Yeah, he was 90 years away. How many years? 20 years. 20 years, in one stretch? Yeah. So he is more or less retired now then? He's home now. Just home for resting or... No, he's home, he came home in 76. And the reason is, well, he got married, and of course then a little one come on the way, see? So he's not going out in the military anymore? Oh, yeah. He will? Oh, yeah, he still goes out. The both of them do, so does the boy, too. But, you see, down in Uruguay, you've been married, they couldn't live on what they got from the society, see? So they would have to have a work, and they can't get a work, because they're not citizens. So he had to come home. So that's how, otherwise he would have stayed there yet. Oh, I see, so he liked it down there? Oh, yeah, sure, it's nice people. I was down there. My wife and I, we was down there in 70, 75. Visited for three weeks. Oh, I see. But it's a very nice, friendly people. So there is a church down there? Oh, yeah, there are several congregations down there. And they have schools, too? We don't, the only schools that we have is where the children been kicked out of the school, because they will not salute the flag or sing the national anthem. We don't take part in any patriotic services like that. So they're taken out, and of course, then we take them into the school. So they get an education. So you are serving in many different ways. So help the people. Help the people. That's the purpose. That was the end of interview with Harry Olson, Rockford, Illinois. End of interview.
