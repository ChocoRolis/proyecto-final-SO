 What kind of living was he doing after then? Was he a miner? Hal told me, my cousin, I miss the old man. So he fixed up a role, vetting and so on, sleep outside. So he liked that kind of life? They all have a little pickaxe, you know, get out there and look for claims. Prospecting. Yes. I found a number of places. Then I went for the north, up to Washington State and up to Seattle. What year was this, in the 1960s? Same time when we was out. Idaho. Was it Idaho or Colorado? I had an aunt out there. Idaho. I had an aunt out there, Aunt Emma. That's right, Emma. And she was feeling something terrible. That's right. Her wrist like this. I'm skinny, but she was thinner yet. But her husband, he was a baseball fan. A big one. Big fella. Oh boy. And you knew what he was doing. And then their son, Elmer. And I remember him as a kid when I was on the farm. As small as I was. And because they had me in a wagon one time and they were running like dickens. It was stony there, see. And I fell off. What the heck? I hit my shoulder or some doggone thing. But that passed away. But I met him and his wife and they met children too. But they were married. Two boys they did. I remember two boys. And, yeah. So there were quite a few of the Yandbergs that came over there. Oh, I hope to tell you. How many brothers was it? Your dad and Gustav? It was five boys and three girls. They all came over to this country? Yeah. Two years after my dad and his two brothers came over here. So they helped each other then? Yeah. Send over tickets or money for them? That's right. They paid the passage fee. So your father now and the rest of the brothers up in Ischpemingen, when did they decide to go down to this area, Rockfort? What year did he come down here? They were born in 1896. Yeah. It must have been about 1890. They came down here? Yeah. I think so. It was around then. Do you know the reason why they came down this way? Yes. You should. Yeah. He was not married then? My old grandma. Great grandma. Yeah, great grandma. Old Pitsan, she'd say. She was part of a gypsy, I think. Yeah, she was. Gypsy descent. That's right. You mean on your father's side? In Sweden. On your father's side? No, his mother. Oh, his mother's side. But they didn't travel. They didn't travel. No. Her father. That was his father's mother. Her father was a smelter. And by golly, I saw a place out in the river. Oh, they were up there. But the water had receded then when I saw it in Sweden. And round, sandstone, round. And I don't know how they... It's okay, Keisha. How they sealed that. But they used water. I knew you would. Your grandpa now, or morfar, he married a gypsy then? Yeah. Oh. Right. So how could you see then? Some remnants then up there where you visited the place? This big sandstone, you said? Yeah. So you could see the place where morfar had worked? And his wife's parents. So they were smelters, you said? They were smelters? Yeah. In the mines. The old man, that had been my great-grandfather. Great-grandfather. And great-grandma. Pizza! She's a big woman, and believe me, there wasn't a time I stopped her. She was a wonderful lady. Oh, you met her too, here in Rockford? And you came to Rockford then on your mother's side? Great-grandma lived with her daughter and your auntie, and she sat in the rocker most of the time in the kitchen, remember? Yeah. Yeah, she was something and everything. Pizza, nothing done. Pizza! She never worried about anything. Nothing. All she said was pizza. That took care of the whole thing. So she took it kind of easy then? I met her, and that was really quite a thing. She lived with her daughter, and she always sat in the rocking chair in the middle of the kitchen. And my aunt, Gio. Auntie Louise. So your father then came to Rockford? Yeah. And the reason they came here was because of, like you said earlier... Well, it was an adventure, I think, mostly. The Germans always been adventurous. They heard something about Rockford, there was better living conditions down here, I suppose, than up in the mines. Oh, yeah. Upper Michigan. Yeah. And he was not married when he came here to Rockford. Oh, no. So he came here in the 1890s. And then he brought his help, brought and helped bring the rest of the clan here. Oh, they all came here then? Yep. Oh, my father worked... with his neighbor, who was named Miller. Up on a farm. Yeah, he had a farm next to him. Here in Rockford? Yeah. On Sandy Hollow. Sandy Hollow. An old farmhouse still stands. Is this southeast of Rockford? Yeah. I've been to that house. And she worked as a maid for the Millers. That's how my dad got acquainted. Oh, I see. Your mother. Yeah. So that was about 1890. Because my sister is 22 months older than I am. She's still living up at P. Peterson's home. Oh, I see. Her family is all gone, except the kids. And his younger brother, Elmer Durnberg, he was well-known in Rockford. He passed away. He died on the 16th of January, 1985. So they married, and then... And what kind of work was he doing then after he married? Your dad? Farming. He farmed. He farmed? Well... No, not really. The latest years here, he was night watchman, one furniture factory. But they did have a little farm out on Sandy Hollow. But I remember when we were on the farm. I know that. So you were born then on Sandy Hollow? Yeah, yeah. Or raised out there, too? On the farm, yeah. So you had to start to help out with farming and... How old were you when you moved to town? How old were you when your dad moved to town? How old were you when you left the farmhouse and came to town? Well, I'll tell you. I did know once, but I forgot. We came to Rockford to help in 1901. 1901. My dad... He overstrained himself working. One year he was in the hospital most of the time. They called it City Hospital. That was Rockford Hospital. And St. Anthony. There were two hospitals. And there were no insurance at that time of any sort. How could he afford to pay for the... Well... Oh, he always managed to have money, as far as I can remember. Yeah, he saved his money. Oh, yeah, he had money. Not a lot, but he had enough to take care of things. I know that much. And your mother, if he didn't, your mother, she could make three nickels out of a dime. Well, I'll tell you. We had a... We had an ice house. They held 22 loads of ice. Out on the farm? Out on the farm, sure. They put it in sawdust. And you took the ice then on the Kiswaki? Wood, wood, chips. Sawdust? Yeah, like sawdust. Oh, yeah, they took it out of the river. Them days they got to take the ice out of the river, didn't they, Dad? There were no cars at all. They took blocks of ice out of the river. The horse and wagon. And then they sold the ice in Rockford, door to door? No, they took it home and stirred them in there. They sawed the ice out. But they had ice houses on all the farms them days. Packed them in sawdust, kept them from men. But did the people in Rockford, didn't they buy from those ice houses? Yeah, they did. Oh, you called them. What was it? No, the one we used to buy for... What was it? We didn't have any refrigeration. We didn't have a telephone. Didn't have electric light. No, not on the farm. But I remember when we were married on South Fourth Street, we had one of those ice boxes, you know, cool with a piece of ice in it. It wasn't that brought them to us. I know. Roberta, he brought the milk. I remember that. But whoever brought the ice, I forgot. But it was a chunk of ice, kapunk, once a week in the night. Go out and pay him, and then he paid. And that was delivered by horse and wagon? No, he hadn't. The guy that delivered the ice to us, didn't he have an old truck? There was no truck. There wasn't any automobiles. I'm trying to remember, because when he used to come, I could hear him in the back hall, and I'd go out and pay him. Oh, in town. Yeah, that was when he moved to South Fourth Street, Second Avenue. No, I'm talking about... Dr. Guston. Yeah, you're talking about the farm, but I happen to remember that. So there was some extra business then, your dad, with this ice? No, no, no. It was just for his own household? Sure, yeah, he kept it. I see. We had snow. We had snow at times. I remember as a kid, you couldn't see the top of the fence post. Oh. Yeah. So then you had to stay inside all day. What were you doing all day then, when you were sitting inside and drawing? I was only five years old. I know. But you became very interested in mechanics. Yeah. And tool and dye and all that. Yeah. When did they start to put in your head about that? Oh, I see. I bet you were about 15, something like that. I started roughly dying to... wait a minute, wait a minute. Yeah, I was just going to say that. You worked for mechanics before that, didn't you? I worked for mechanics, yeah. But like your dad, no. Was he interested in that kind of work? No, he was a farmer. No, my dad died in 1910. Oh, but before he died, was he interested... In mechanics? No. Not at all? No. He was a farmer. So where did you get this from, from your mother's side or the family? Everybody knows. I think, I'm telling you, he developed it by himself. No, no. Being interested in things. Here you have this man, Andrew Wayne up in Idaho. He was a prospector. Yeah. And your father, he was a farmer and an iron worker. Yeah. And then you come along here and you get this tremendous gift of putting things together, mechanically. Yeah, they did. Yeah. Did you start to study something or read on it? I tell you, I saw the hardships that people were going through. When you were little? I'm going to try to better myself. I worked in mechanics. And I don't know what... But I... The tool room was next to the office. In fact, it was built like this. And down. And we were up on the second floor. One time I built a sample joint. And then we were working 14 hours a day. So I worked all day. And the night until 11.30, that was the last streetcar. That's right. Because I lived downtown. You had moved in from the farm then? Oh, yeah. You lived on the street? Not on South Fourth Street, yes, I think so. And Mother didn't think I'd go to work next day. It was Friday. She never woke me. Here comes one of the guys by the name of Burward, John Burward. That's right. Working the tool room there, too. He and his brother, both. He says, you come into my bedroom. He said, ain't you going to go to work? What time is it? Six o'clock, he said. In the morning? I took off right away. Mother was going to be good to him and let him sleep a little extra. Got a streetcar out and got out there to work. And I finished the job about 4.30 that afternoon. Didn't stop for lunch or nothing. Here was a guy, the chief engineer, waiting with a grip and a suitcase. And then the superintendent, Carl Anderson. And I finished the job. They didn't dare tell me, say anything to me. They didn't then. They left you alone. Because they'd disturb me. And I got it all finished. They had a fellow named Jackson. We had a little plating set up. This is a sample joint. They called it the safe joint. Swenson was the chief engineer. Anderson was superintendent. Faust, Faust Hotel. Hotel? He was a beneficiary? Yeah. He was a wonderful fellow. And Ekstrom, Eric Ekstrom. Another Ekstrom. That made it. So I finished it and they gave it to him. And then he was ready to take it. After he had it plated, then I took off and went home. They went to Detroit. And that was an oil proof joint. The very first made? You bet your life. Did you invent this one? No, no, no. You only worked on it? Yeah. I made it. You made it. How did you get this proof? I mean safe. So the oil didn't want to leak through. How did you? It's hard to tell you. They were made in two halves. And I didn't make the dies for them. They were made. Because they didn't have any punch buses there either. So two days' work then together, together? Yeah. And I finished it all for them. Well then I worked a while and then I was going to quit. I wanted to go over to Rockford and drop forage. I wanted to learn something about foraging dies. I wanted to learn. So an old man, Frost, came out and talked to me. He says, I understand you're going to leave us here. Well, I said, why? Well, I said, I just want to learn something about it. He says, you're not built for that kind of work. That's heavy work, hard work. It was too, by gosh. Well, but I did. I went over there. I learned something. Rockford forage? Oh, yeah. I run a lathe there. It had a faceplate this size. Yeah. Big chuck. And we had a phony guy in charge. If you couldn't break a machine, you weren't doing the job right. Boom, boom, boom, boom. Well, I worked there. And I used to repair cars at home. How old were you then, about 18? Huh? How old were you, about 18, 19? I don't think you were. It was before he was married, though. Yeah. I didn't even know him at that time. So you had started thinking it all with, also with cars? Yeah, but... I took an hour off one day from the boss at the drop forage. He said, I'd like to take off. I want to go out to the bird ring company and get some piston rings. Sure, go ahead, he said. He was working on cars. So I did. I went out there and got those piston rings. And the next day, up comes... The boss. The big boss and his son. Faleen, his name was, Faleen. His son prated right along with him all the time. Right on his tail, just like a little puppy. He came up to me and handed me a check. I said, what's that for? Well, he says, your boss says you're more interested in automobiles than you are in this game, he says. Oh. Okay. Okay, yeah. I said, that's okay. I don't think I'll stay here much longer anyhow. I don't like your place. Or you either. That's the truth. So I left. And then I worked for a small jobbing shop. And they were making stereotype machinery for a fellow named Brown. And he had connections in Chicago. Bonnet Brown, they called him. And this Bonnet Brown, they made pictures of... I said, it wasn't advertising concerns, really, what it was. But I did the graduating where the saw, you know. They had to be one column wide or two columns wide. And the height had to be 918 thousandths, his high type. And then they had a low type, 152 thousandths. We never messed with that. And Brown knew that. He was getting the shaft. And we had two, three other guys working there. We were busy on it. But he was really getting the shaft. Brown came to me. Say, I'd like to go into business with me. Let's see, that was 1920. That's before that. Yeah, yeah. Before that. Before you were married. Oh, yeah, yeah. You were married 1919. I didn't have a car, I used to walk two and a half miles. Regardless of weather, you know. I carried my lunch in a building 22 by 50. A big potbelly stove, that's all. All the heat ready. And I had to get out there early to get the heat going. We had a few guys working. And we really made it by dusk. I know you did. I took on anything, all kinds of work. And besides this, we shipped 319 casting boxes one year. 97 saws. And 200 lino casters. That's a little different. And things were going. We had a neighbor, Brown did, on London Ave, 516. He was a pattern maker. He designed these for us. He did a good job of designing. I couldn't go into all the details because it would take too long. They were for printing presses and... Yeah, not cylindrical work. Flatbed work. We could adjust the plates. And the steel come 1918. You could see that machine. So you were able then to... How did you buy the machines now? You were a companion with this guy then? You were companions now with this guy? Yeah. Brown and Joe. Brown and Joe Jenberg. Ray Brown. But they called it Ray Brown Company. How were you able to get money? I only had a third interest in it. But how were you able to borrow money then? How much money did you have? I had a room quest on Broadway. I bought furniture. By golly, he had money. Oh, and a beautiful man. We were very good friends. So he took a chance too on three guys coming in here. I took a chance on Joe alone. Really. And then I... We contacted Dixon. Reynolds Wire Company. They made screen wire. That's right. Screens. Now the machines we built for them, I bought a milling machine from Sunstrand. It had a 15-horse motor sitting on the floor and three V-belts on it. We got three of these machines that were about that long. We put up there and lined them up. I engineered all that. We milled the slots in there. And then we had two bars and one inch hard-sheet cam to graduate. Pretty tricky. I worked to get them out to all. We were going along fine. I hired the help. I had Hockey Turnquist with me and some other guys. I trained them. Everything worked fine. But then we had a bobbin spool, they called it. That's right. A narrow base about that long. It had a spindle going over this way with a right-hand thread. The other one had a left-hand thread on it. The spindle was 15 inches long. I turned it. I can't tell you. It doesn't matter really. And that spindle had wires on it then? He went down to Dixon himself and come back with two nail cags full of tools. We had an old shack we bought from Camp Grant. That's right, I forgot that. On the railroad tracks. Well, it was all right. It was a fine process. It got you a good start. Well, we had to have someplace to put this stuff. And he went down and he come back and he says, these small narrow ones, machines. He says, when do we deliver? I could have kissed the guy. He says, when do we have to deliver? Three weeks. I says, you're crazier than hell. What's the matter with you? That's what we got to do. I worked night and day. The chips and that I could, I just brushed them aside. Stepped in them and they were gone. Just keep going. We made the delivery. Three weeks. But then I... Come home dirty and tired, and grubby and hungry. That's it. No more chicken wires. That's it. Yeah, I've had it. You know what he did? He took a week off and went up to Adrian, Michigan where he was born. And he... I don't listen. My name comes in there. You were in this business. I know. Why was it so rough delivery time, three weeks? Couldn't they wait another three weeks? For instance, now the guys in the... needing the stuff. Why do they have to rush you all the time? That's why I quit. You quit? Sold out. I told them I wanted it, sold out. Nothing to do with it anymore. You had it. He started his own after that. So then you went on your own. Yeah, I started Rockford Dine, too. Then you didn't have to worry about it. You started yourself? On 17th Avenue. 17th Avenue. Yeah, I started that. I bought the land out there. What happened to Brunckwitz, now they lend you the money for this venture? Did he come out all right? Sure. Oh, he did. He came out all right? Oh, sure. But now when you started up Rockford Dine and Tool, did you go to the bank then? He okayed it. He okayed another loan? Huh? He okayed another loan then? At the bank. At the bank? Yeah. He didn't give me cash, you know. He just okayed my loan. Because you needed some startup money to get started with Tools and... He knew he'd get it....and stuff like that. So then you were on a loan? Yeah. See, I helped organize the City National Bank. You helped organize that? 1945, huh? That took some years of hard work before you got it estate. How many were you? You and who else? Oh, we were nine all together. You and Brunckwitz, Gus Brunckwitz, who else? I used to know... Lindberg. Yeah, that's right. Hauser-Lindberg and Brunckwitz. And... Yeah, I should remember it. How were you able to do that? Summer... Summerfield. Yeah, that's right. And the bank. How were you able to do that? I mean, you just came out of the Depression here. Well... A real tough time. Now, somebody urged me to do that. But you had so many banks in Rockford already. Huh? You had so many banks in Rockford already. You had a Swedish bank there and... Yeah, Third National. There was no bank on Broadway at that time. That's when they started. So another bank was needed? Yeah. Wait a minute. We had... We had a security bank on Broadway. Yeah. Security bank. And that... He wasn't happy with that. That thing failed. During the Depression? I ain't gonna go through that. No, it wasn't. During the Depression. You're not supposed to. No. I'll tell you what went on, but I ain't gonna... Yeah, it ain't gonna end. Oh, but it's history, though. I mean, you know, people find out, you know, what happened and... It could hurt somebody, I imagine. He means... They went under during the Depression? Huh? Yeah. Under the Depression? You bet. Was that the only bank in Rockford that didn't make it? That didn't go under? Yeah. Oh. I'm trying to... Well, Manufacturers Bank, I think, went under. Yeah, I think it did, Dad. So they had to close up then? Yeah. Yeah? And people lost money, of course, and they had mortgages and... I'm sure they did. So how did you do now during the Depression with your Rockford... Work night and day....diet? Work night and day. You could still keep going? Oh, yeah. Yeah? Yeah. You had orders coming in? Oh, yeah. It was all over the place. I lost... It was all over. That helped. I... Whenever I made money, I bought a lot, so... I see. And I lost four lots. In Rockford? Yeah. So land was not a good investment, then, in other words? And I had a house on Rockford Avenue. That was when the Depression started. That was. But it was either the shop or the house. No. So the shop... So there was hard times. They had to have the shop. So now when you took a job, for instance, from people in Chicago, did you deal with Chicago at any time during the Depression? Companies that ordered stuff and they couldn't pay and so on? No. I built tools for AT&T. AT&T? Yeah. But they were good accountants. Oh, sure. They were safe. Yeah. 12th Street and Cicero Avenue. In Chicago? Yeah. And... We had a fellow by the name of Art West, Arthur West, who was our secretary. Oh. Nice guy. Was he related to the Furniture West? Yeah. Yeah, he was. His brother was in charge of standard furniture. Oh, I see. True. Harry West. Yeah, Harry West. He's still living? No, I don't think so. No. He outdid the whole mess. We were in there one Saturday. In Chicago? Yeah, in Chicago. And... I came out. Art was driving. We had a Ford... Did you have the truck that day? No, not truck. Ford coupe. Ford... That's right. Car. Yeah. Four passengers, five passengers. So you go a little ways and he stopped on 12th Street. I... why don't you drive? Wait a minute. They let the girls out first. Five minutes to 12. All traffic stopped on Cicero Avenue and 12th Street too. All traffic. Nobody could drive. There was nothing but people. They had 40,000 employees in there. 40,000? 40,000. No wonder traffic had to be stopped. And I had an appointment one day in there, see. They come out to see me. And the strength of it, we bought a Pratt & Whitney jigboard for accuracy. And they used to come out and see us right along. And we did odd jobs. They didn't want us to lose money. All of it. Some things were just sheet metal. But they had to be accurate, the holes and sheet metal. One day I had an appointment with Mr. Donaldson, nice fellow. And I come to the receptionist first. And she got ahold of him. And he came right over to me. And he says, Mr. Gerber, I'm sorry. He said, but we've got a meeting scheduled for an hour here. And I couldn't control that to call you. Well, I would have. Well, that's all right, I says. How would you like to have the run of the tool room? Oh, I'd like nothing better. I got an education. I bet you did. You're darn right. They had some wonderful designs, I'll tell you that. But I found one that they had designed, and I criticized them. Big company. For their blueprints, that they didn't file the prints in the drawer flat. They rolled them up. Then you get creases in them. You can't see, you know. That's lines, white lines. Yes. But I don't know if I ever rectified it or not. Oh, I'm sure you did. And I took one guy with me in there. And he had found it, and I checked with him to make sure. Yeah, you were right, I says. So I took him with me. Ah. Oh, this is named, you know. But we had a good record there. One day, we were in there. I had ordered some bullets for a job. They call it Dena now, it's up near Broy. That's a good job, I had a good record up there. Yeah. How were they able to find your company, like in Chicago, for instance? Did they send out feelers all over? Yeah, that's right. And checked you out? They contacted us. And they checked you out before they put the order down? Yeah, yeah. If you were doing a good job and so on? Yeah. But how were you paid now? If they come now, for instance, in Chicago and say, we need 10,000 pieces of this here, could you trust them to get paid for it? I mean, you produced 10,000, or did you get payment before they started? They didn't want you to lose money. No, sir, they were that. So you did a good job then, so they didn't want to lose you? No, sir, you betcha. Oh. Yeah, you got some going all over for the best in town. But during the Depression, it was a rough time to collect from people. Everybody had trouble to collect. I know. How did you do it? Well, I'll tell you. I did a lot of work for a fellow named Harding. He was in the printing business. And he was on 7th Street and 6th Avenue. An office for the Rockwell Number Company. And they were right next to him, a small place. And he had a paper-cutting machine. They cut paper about that thick. And I fixed that for him. That's a four-inch slab. I don't know how. Sheets like that? About four inches. It takes a pretty good wrapping to get that. You bet. I fixed that for him. Maybe it was used equipment that he had there. But then he moved down to Market Street, back at the Boston Hotel down there. Right. And you've seen these presses come up, go up and down. And they had a flywheel about that high. Four feet? Three and a half feet, something like that. And it had a hub on it. And a piece of sheet metal so you couldn't get your hands in there. For safety factor. But they had a Pfluger feed made in Germany. For vacuum cups. Air intake. And feed. And I took a piece of chalk and I marked out there. So far. So, they had a cam. I got a piece of steel out here near Harris. Torch-cut steel. The whole thing was probably an inch and a half, inch and a quarter thick. And I was in a hurry. I wanted to get it. And it had just been burnt. So, I found a tong there. And I grabbed that and I put it in the car. And I put a piece of cardboard in there. And I watched that thing when I was driving. I wondered if that darn thing was going to burn through. It was hot when I got back to the shop. And I set that up in a lathe. Cut it. And then we finished it off. We had a machine, a filing machine. We could file everything. Horse file. And I hooked that up. And it ran perfect. I put a screw in, a long screw to hold it. And those suction cups would go down and pick up the thing. Steady. So, he appreciated that. Well, we had a recession. In the 30s? And we had to sell our jig borer and a brand new shaper. You had to sell it? Yeah. But did you get anything for it? No, we didn't get what we ought to have because we had to have working capital. You didn't need the capital. So, I went into Chicago. This one place. And... They gave a loan to a government agency. And... Well, we... I brought those papers back. And we got a threat from the federal... There was no federal building in Rockford. It was in Freeport. Jersey. So... See now... Hello. Oh, yeah. What's the matter? But we... In the Rockford Trust building, State and Main Street. It was up on the third floor, I think it was. They had a fellow named Beal that took care of these complaints and so on. So, we had a contract with Home Page. Home Page. They put up the buildings. And we owed them... How much? It cost us $28,000 for the building. I'm not telling you all the money, don't ask. God, we couldn't afford to lose the building. So, I sweat... But I told Art West in the morning... Before we go over there... Oh, no, I see this Beal. And I says, you still have the contract with the Home Page Company? Oh, yes, he says. As long as you got it, I'm not worried. No, he says. And I go back to him the next six months. I still had it. The third time I went back to him, he says, Mr. Jernbrew... They've taken an awful licking on a lot of their contracts. This is one they wanted to keep. Boy, now I am worried. You have reason to be, he says. I went to Chicago to see this outfit and so on. So, Art West, he listened to me, what I had to say. And he says, Joe, look at here. Here's a check... From Ray Harding. He thinks the sun rises and sets in you. Oh, boy, I said. So, we went over there. And Page had us. They were ready to jump on us. Just that fast. Oh, yeah, they weren't going to wait. And... And all that. Home, Philip Home. I knew him very well, he was a nice fellow. They argued about it and so on. Then Phil Home said, listen, boys, we made money on this... On this building in 1928. Let's give the boys a break. And he held out that check. They grabbed it. Okay. So, we slept from there on. We had a few good sleep nights. So, that was a pretty unstable time, though. Oh, you bet your life. There was this kind of life, not to worry about bills and renting and loaning money and stuff. That was not in your... Well... Thought so much. You wanted to think with mechanics. With tool making and dyeing and everything like that. So, there was a lot of worrying then, too. I made dyes with big washing machine companies. One in Chicago. And... Twelve dyes, they weighed over 10,000 pounds. I designed the dyes, did all the mathematical work. So, you had a big order then. So, we had... We ran out five dyes. I took a fellow by the name of Laurie Johnson with me. He was also on standby. Yeah. Laurie. Good mechanic. Good Laurie. Knew what was going on. Oh, yeah. And I took him with me. He ran the boring mill. So, we set up these five dyes. I had my partner. I got a limp again. I ain't gonna say it. No. He... So, you were still three dyes. No, this is another partner. Another partner. When I was with Ray Brown, he come down. He got a job. Ray hired him. And... Oh, he wanted to go into business. No question about money. Yeah. He had money. And he had contacts in Chicago. Felt and tear. Big outfits, you know. But it was beneficial to be a companion. I mean, wouldn't it be better to be alone? Huh? Wouldn't it be better you being alone? Sure. You're German corporation. Yeah, but I... But you needed more capital. Yeah, sure. Sure, still. I thought I'd been through so much, you know. And here, he had plenty of money. Oh, he had the money. But in other words, you were sufficient enough in your brain to think about everything about the dye making. You didn't need any help on that. Daddy didn't. You knew that spectrum. He was known all over the territory. He couldn't make a decent sketch. But it was the money. He could offer you the money. That's the reason you took him in. Not that much, either. All he had was a big mouth, big feet. So... Again. Oh, fire. Fire truck. Fire truck. That's it. So you took him in then as a partner? I took... You couldn't make him equal though in the company that you had built up? There's two of them. Must be the ambulance, the second one. Oh, yeah. Harris was the tool supervisor in Chicago, see? And... Oh, yeah. He knew him. I asked my partner. No. He'd been in Chicago with him. And it was a grinder hand. Every time he went to Chicago, the grinder hand wasn't working. He went with him. He went to see a ball game. So I had to have sheer on a die. Inside the door panel on the door. And all pieces were marked, you know, with electric pencil. You couldn't get into a grinder in there. Then Laurie come up with a brilliant idea. I said, listen. We can't get into a grinder here. Why don't we go back to Rockford, take the parts out of this die. And we correct it when we get back. They're all marked. Sure. It's a swell idea, Laurie. You were thinking... Poor Laurie. He was a peach. Couldn't get into a grinder there. So I got back. And I said, who's in charge here? Wally Dunston. Wally. He did not. Lathe hand. He couldn't even hold it. No, he didn't know nothing about die work. So I said, well... Carl didn't either, so it's all right. I checked into everything. I got a hold of one guy. And I told him to grind these parts. I'd give him the exact description and everything else. Drawing, rough drawing. Got that started. And I looked over the rest of them. And here was one that Ben Carlson was working on. He was a good man, too. He must have had a few too many drinks or something like that. I... There's four places. We had an opening. We sheared off the pieces. And we had two girls operating. They both had both hands up here. Switches. The other girl the same way, before they can trip the press. And they tripped that press. I was there. And Harris, the tool supervisor, came over. He says, how much shear you got on that? I said, one metal thickness. I told Dahlgren I had to have three metal thickness. He said, that's a partnership. That idiot. Well, we sure do, I says. Jesus, that was an awful bang. So he stripped the iron. We got back, it was ten minutes after six. And we had those parts. And I put Koji to work grinding these parts. Then I says, uncrate this thing, quaff a damn lumber. That's heavy lumber. Good stuff. We got it for nothing. A bridge builder lived close to it. And... So we stripped the lumber off. And I said, now, well, just drill and tap a hole here, here, there, and there. In the corner. And tap a quarter inch. Then take a piece of sheet metal, bend it up, and then bend it the other way. So they disappear. You can't load those things up. And you break the press. Oh, yeah. Fix that up. Well, it was late. And I said... I checked into all the other guys. And I says, will you fellas stick around? Across the street, the guy sold hooch. And I'm going to treat the boys when I get through here. We got through at two o'clock. Come on. I made arrangements with Jigs. The drinks are on the house. When the boys got through, then Jones transferred here, they were supposed to pick up the dice. They had 930? Yeah. I called them right away. Had them come in at 330. 430, I said. 430. I think it was 430. I said, okay. So they had their drinks and they came back in. I was going to pull the old time cards out. No, I said, we'll take care of it. We have a humpback crane. While we were over there at Jigs, I was with them. Norrie said, here comes the truck. So they were an hour early anyhow. They had a big truck. We had five, eight big dice. Took a crane. I'd been working so hard, going like a dick. I went home and took a hot bath. I said, Norrie, I'll pick you up at 630. Or six o'clock. Something like that. Okay. And I did. I picked him up. And we passed the truck around Terrioville. That's the other side of Belgium. Old Rock 20. And they were driving slow. I'll tell you, Jigs, they had a heck of a load. Loads like that. Heavy stuff. Oh. You couldn't take them in on the tow-way. They wouldn't let you through. Yeah. And we went in there and delivered the dice. Then Harris came over to me and he says, Mr. John Ruby, he says,
