 Yeah, we have 24th of November 1986 and I was sitting together with Mary Wilson in Rockford, Illinois. And you were born 1932, 18th of February in Rockford. Your parents now, Allan Siegfried Dahlberg, he was from Kinnerum of Östergötland in Sweden and also your mother, she came from there, Gertrud Frida, she was born Stoyernagel. She was born in Germany. But came to Sweden then as a young girl or how did she end up there? About seven or eight. Her family came over. To Sweden? Her whole family, about six sisters I think. And they went up to Borås then, to the textile factories or how come they ended up in Borås? Her dad was a boss. They liked the German bosses, German people, to boss them. I don't know why. Oh, I see. So he was like a foreman then? He was a foreman, yeah. In the textile mills? I don't know. I don't know. His cousin Esther knows a lot more about it because she grew up with him. I see. This your mother's sister or your father's? My dad's cousin. Oh, your dad's cousin. So and what's your father now? His name was Allan Dahlberg. He was born there and his father was a textile worker. Is that what it says right in that book? That's a textile town. Yeah, yes. That's a textile town. So he started to work also then in the textile mills. Did he tell you anything about that? He started but then he decided to come here. Then he became a furniture worker. Oh, I see. So how old was he when he came here to Rockford? I think he was about 26 years old. Oh, that old? Uh-huh. Oh, so he had worked quite a few years then in the textile mills. And he came over here to some relation or how did he end up in Rockford? I think his cousins, a couple cousins came first. They changed their name to Dahlberg also, Oscar and Gus Dahlberg, although they were on the other side of the family. But they all, all the cousins changed their name to Dahlberg. Your father changed the name though. And Oscar and Gus changed their name. I don't know what their name was. So they all became Dahlberg here in Rockford. All became Dahlberg. I see. So when he came here then, did he tell you about the reason why he left? He was 26 and apparently met your mother at that time. Yes. But he went over first alone. Yes. And he came to Custis here in Rockford. He came to Rockford. And what kind of work was he getting that he was at the furniture mill? Furniture. And there was no textile? No. He didn't look for it either, I suppose. I don't know. There was some here back then. But he never worked there? No. So which one of the factories did he work at? The Empire? Republic? Rockford? Rockford. Rockford Furniture? I think so. It's, you know, it's hard to remember all the names. And he came to the United States in 19... I don't know what year, 1924 probably. 1923 or 24. And he came along then too. Did he live with some of his cousins then or did he... Do you know where he... I don't know. Roomed or boarded? Esther knows. I should have her here. So this Esther Dahlberg now... Esther Durenberg. She married... She married Joe. Oh, Joe Durenberg. Joe Durenberg. Do you know him? Oh, yes. I talked to them. It's the same one. Okay. And why did you marry Joe? Well, because they were... She was a Swedish. She still is. Her whole family came. Yeah, yeah. So they are the same cousins then? Their family, yeah. And she's cousin too. She is very much Swedish. Oh, yeah. Cousin to Oscar and Gus too. Yeah. So there was a big family and they were already here then because she was young when she came. Yeah, I think they were. I think they were. So they came together with them then. So then he married in 1925. He sent for your mother. Yeah. And she came over. Yes. And where did they live then? Did they rent an apartment on the east side of... Yeah, they rented an apartment on the east side. Then they came out here and he built a little house over here, still here. And then when he died, it was left to me. Now my son has it, he's living over there. Oh, I see, in this area here. That's right, it's right behind us. So why did he go out? Was it the farmland or out here then? He wasn't farming because we still have chickens, but he liked to be out in the country. It was the country, now there's more houses, you know. So it was open then? It was one of the first houses perhaps in the 1930s? Probably. So he moved there during the Depression then? Mm-hmm. And you were born in 1932? I lived in the house for 18 years until I got married. And he was still working in Rockford? Well, yeah. I mean, on the other side of town. Yeah, he went from the furniture to a barber, Coleman, and he worked as a machine finisher, painting and sanding, machine. So he had to have a car then? Because this is a lot of distance. He always had a car, yeah. And he didn't think it was too far to go back and forth every day to out here? No. He wanted to be out in the country? Yeah. So get the fresh air from the factory chimneys. Yeah. And the chickens and the ducks and the garden. But no cow? No cow. No pigs? No, but a neighbor up the street has goats. He drinks. He drank goat milk. Oh, I see, for his health. So and you had another little sister that was born in 1936? Yes. A little bit younger. So where did you go to school here at the time? Lincoln Park School. It's a mile from here. So you had to walk there every day then? Yeah, we thought nothing of it. My mother didn't drive. Everybody walked back then. Dad had a car then? Dad took the car to work. Mother didn't drive. During the Depression, was he able to have a full time job? I don't think so. I think he worked for WPA. And I asked him one time, I says, well, why do we have these kerosene lights? He said, because we can't afford to burn electricity, he said. So there was tough times then? But he made it. We made it. When he worked for WPA, was he sent away from Rockport or was he working in? In the area. In the area? On the roads and the various buildings and projects they had? So you don't remember those tough times? It seemed like the food we had was quite a bit the same. Pork and beans, I think. And chicken. And stuff like that. And then coming up during the war years, there was more full employment. So you started with Barbara Coleman again? Yes. And then my mother, later on, she started at, oh, that factory that went out of business. National Lock. National Lock. Work nights. Oh, I see. Screw machine assembly or something like that. So how did she get into work then? There was no bus. She was not driving herself? Oh, she took the bus. But it was bussed out of State Street? Uh-huh. I see. So she just walked out. And that's a long, that's almost a mile too. We think that's enough. So she worked nights then? Yes. So you were there, stayed home during the daytime, I mean, nighttime, and to watch you and then you went to school? Did she continue with that during the war years? Did she, Dad? I don't know if it was during, I know she was working when I met my husband in 1949. She was working then. And the war was over then, wasn't it? Yes. Yeah, I think it was right after the war that she worked. She worked, yeah. Uh-huh. And your dad, he continued for? Oh, he continued for many years, 35 years, Barbara Coleman. He was 70 years old when he retired. They don't let him work that long now. No, they don't go to 50. Really? I don't know. So you went to school then at Lincoln. How about high school? Did they have you out here too? No, it was West High. We went to Roosevelt. We went to Lincoln Park for eight years. And then we went to Roosevelt. And we went to West High. I see. And then you started to work or? No, I got married. You got married? Uh-huh. Became a homemaker. Oh, okay. How about, did you belong to a church out here? We belonged to a Messiah Lutheran church up there on the highway. This is not the Swedish church though? No. It's American Lutheran? Uh-huh. Oh. So you were not confirmed in Swedish? Yeah, I was not in Swedish, no, but I was confirmed. In the Messiah Lutheran? Uh-huh. Okay. Did they belong to any organizations like Vasa, Vikings? Oh, yes. They did? Vasa and, Swiss Children's Center? Yes. Well, I thought that was a park. There was a park there. That sounds awful familiar. I think you belonged to all of them. So you went into meetings then in town? Uh-huh. And Leskvitterklubben, did you belong to that one? Sounds familiar. But you don't remember attending anything of- Oh, yeah. We went to dinner or something. And dances and- I didn't. Yeah, I was young, you know. You didn't participate with the Swedes too much then? Well, wherever he went, you know, we went. Of course, we had babysitters too, you know. So how did you meet your husband? Oh, he is born in Pempa, Texas. That's a long way from home. I met him at the Church of Christ. I see. And then I became a member of Church of Christ and we got married in 1950. I see. And he is of English background? I think so. Maybe Irish too. English, Irish. He's got a redheaded brother. Dutch? English and Dutch. So how is the Swedish culture? Well, I'm naturally, I'm proud to be a Swede. And I think the Swedes stick together. It's a bond. Whoever is a Swede, I love them. I don't care who they are. They're Swede. You know, I don't know. They're so great. Did they talk much about Sweden, your parents? Oh yeah. What did they, did they, were they homesick you think at the time that you felt that they were sitting talking about old times or? Yes. It was hard to leave. They left everybody. Both mother and dad left both, everybody they had over there. So I grew up without grandparents and cousins and aunts and uncles. I missed out. Did they go back at any time, visiting? I think each of them went back two times, but not together. So one had to be home and the... But they didn't, they waited till we were gone. I see. So and you visited Sweden in what year? 1970. 1970. So you had the, you have cousins over there. Yes. Your parents, they corresponded with those people over there of course. And did you continue that on and after? Yes. You still do? Yes. In English or? In English. And they write to you in English too? They write in Swedish. And I write in English. And you are able to read? Some of it, but I, I've been getting help from Esther, but I got a letter the other day from Sweden. It was concerning my mother's side of the family, some kind of inheritance or something. So I went to the bank. I was the first national bank has a Swedish girl working there. So she could read it to you? Mm-hmm. So you understood what it was all about? So now you might go over there and pick up an inheritance? Well, not really. I think these two aunts, one died and then the other one is still alive. So I just assume she'd live. You know, I don't want, I'm no hurry. And I don't know anything about it. So you visited your parents' home then, both your mother's and especially your father's home? I didn't see the, I didn't see mother's, but I saw my dad's. Is he still standing there? Yes. Yes. Did they resemble what he had told you earlier or about the area? Well, I've always known the home because we've always had pictures of it. And my dad's sister lives next door. Oh, I see. Ingeborg. No, Sigrid, Sigrid. Did they resemble your father in manners and? Yes. And I saw cousins that I look like, which I was thrilled because I haven't seen many people look like me. You know, it was nice. They were nice. You compared notes, though, what you liked and disliked and so on, and did it so you could see the relation. And were you able to speak to them in Swedish? Like a child. But they also understood a few English words. Yes, they take English early. But how about the older people, like your father's? They don't understand too much. Your father's sister didn't understand anything. Well, Ingeborg has learned Swedish, I mean English. She's really, you know, she's on to everything. She understands. She spoke to you, didn't she, Lyle Ingeborg, a little bit in English? Or you had your husband with you? No, she was over here, too. Oh, I see. So the books now that your father had left, a lot of handwritten documentation about textile weaving, he wrote those books. So he apparently was into textile trade, in other words, to learn it. But he never used them over here? I don't think like that. It's too bad, isn't it? He never commented about it? Oh, he commented about it, but he never went into that. So that was written in 1912, when he was home in Sweden. So he apparently went to some trade school to learn the trade. How was he interested in politics? Not too much. No? No. He didn't study anything in town? No. He voted, though. They always voted. So what year did he become a citizen? Or was it before you? Well, I have the papers in a green box. I don't know. That wasn't the 30s? Probably. Perhaps. Was he Republican or a Democrat? I don't know. I think he leaned toward a Democrat. I'm not sure. But he was not active in the Russian politics? No. I'm not really sure. Really, I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I'm not really sure. Really. If he was a Democrat or a Republican. A Republican. Was he? He was a Republican. I don't remember. Isn't that awful? That's a picture of us up there. My dad is in the bottom there. So, your sister She passed away. Was she married also then? No. My sister's not in that picture. That's our daughter and our daughter-in-law. Yeah, she was only 30 when she passed away. Was that sudden or...? She had pneumonia. She died on the way to the hospital. Your father, now, he died what year? 1980... Yeah, 1983, October 5th. Did he go back to Sweden in later years then? Yes, a couple of times. What did he say then when he came back? Did he stay long enough to meet a lot of people? Did he meet some of his old friends? Yes, yes, he enjoyed... You know, when they come over here, they're torn between two countries. So he was old, so he couldn't... lose the grip of the one he came from? No, but you know, he got so old and sick that he couldn't go anymore. So he lived out here too then? All this time, many years. And your mother died before him? Yes. She was killed in an automobile accident right down on the end of the street here. October 3rd, 1963... October 4th, 1963. So I took care of him for about 20 years. It started out kind of slow, you know. He married again too, but they got divorced. I was married a couple of years to her. When your father came back from Sweden after visiting, I suppose, some of the textile factories over there, he didn't say he missed it or he regretted leaving for the United States? No. So he had a good job then at Bob McCormick? Yes. As a machinist? No, he was a machine finisher. He painted and finished them. Oh, I see. Sanded them. I think his profession would be called painter. He ran into one of his old friends over in Sweden, and his friend thought he should be rich. He thought my dad should be rich? In America. So that's what they thought. They expected him to come back with gold in his pockets, huh? Uh-huh. Well, I think that's why they went over and came over in the first place. They thought this was the land of opportunity, which it is. I think in a way it's kind of too bad he left. You know, we didn't get to be with all them nice relatives. But he had a relation over here too, though? Cousins. Like Esther, you and Bergen, and all of us. Yeah, we became close because that's all we had. So you visited each other quite often? Uh-huh. We were close. We still are. She was a homemaker for many years. You know, raised her own food and canned it. And did everything. Well, they didn't even have gas for a while. Cooked on a wood stove. Had a wood stove to heat the house. So they could get some firewood around here, though, because it was like... It was the woods. We had to chop down a lot. He gave me this lot on my 18th birthday. We had to chop down a lot of trees. So he bought the whole parcel of land here? Uh-huh. He got the whole parcel. I see. So he went out there in the 30s and settled? Uh-huh. Maybe even before then. Maybe it was the... well, it must have been the 30s. It is quite a distance, though, if you... at that time, I suppose, when it... Well, sometimes. I remember him saying during the Depression, he got a lamp wick that didn't fit, and he walked downtown to get his nickel back. He walked back? That's what he said. He didn't have a car, you know, then. Or if he had a car, he couldn't afford to drive it. But, uh... It was a long walk. To town, I think it's about three miles. Yeah, and then he went over to 7th Street. That's where the Swedish stores were. Were you often visiting town? Mm-hmm. With your parents, then? You went in on Saturdays or Sundays, or how did you...? Whenever they went. So it's three miles? I think so. It seems further, though, when you... Does it? I draw slow, I suppose. I was looking for the right street. I always say, I say we're displaced Swedes. I mean, there's not many Swedes. There's very few on the West Side. Uh-huh. So who were living here at that time, moving in? Are there not too many Swedes? There was another Swedish family up next door. How about in the school? What kind of kids were they then? Not many Swedes. No? No. Not many Swedes. Irish, Italians, or...? No, mostly just regular kids, but there weren't many Italians. I think they're on the other side of town. But they were not out here? No. Not Polish people either? No. So they were Yankees here on that side. Yes. So did you talk Swedish in your home all the time? Yes. You talk English back to them, though? No, I spoke Swedish. To them? Yes, we spoke Swedish. And then when I went to school, I had a Swedish accent. And the kids made fun of me, so I said, I'm not going to speak Swedish anymore. But then it came back to me when I went to Sweden. Well, I went to a library, you know, and got some records and tried to study a little bit. So how old were you then when you, when they noticed that you spoke with an accent? In the grade school? First grade. First grade? First grade. So they noticed immediately? They noticed it. Were you the only one that you think that spoke a foreign language out here? The rest of them were English speaking? As far as I know. So this was it? You told your parents that this was the last time? Yeah. But it wasn't. But you had no trouble, though the teacher didn't tell you to drop the Swedish or anything? No, no. It was just that I learned to speak. You picked up certain words? Like Cher and Sherry and, you know, things, you know. You were listening to them, they said? Yeah. But they went away after a while, and you had to work on it harder, you think? No. No, kids don't have to work too hard, you know. So when you played around with the neighborhood kids here, then it was all English? Mm-hmm. I had a girlfriend that lived up on the next block, and her folks were from Denmark. Mm-hmm. Did they speak Danish in their home, you think? No. No? Unless they spoke maybe to each other, but not to their children. So they spoke English, then? Mm-hmm. And the nearest door, you had to walk out to the State Street? Munson's. Munson? Over there, it's called West State Certified. It's a mile. And there was a general store? Mm-hmm. Where you could buy everything. They didn't talk Swedish in there? I don't know. No, they didn't. No. My mother and dad learned to speak good English. My dad had an accent more than mother, didn't he, Lyle? He always kept a slight accent. And did they have any Swedish papers in their home? Swedish newspaper? Yes. They came every week? I don't know if they came every week or once a month. In Chicago, or you don't know? Chicago. In Chicago. So when you visited 7th Street, then you were in Sweden? Definitely? Yeah, there were a lot of Swedes there. You did notice there was a difference in language spoken there? Oh, yeah. In the stores and all over the place. Hear my parakeet out there trying to sing? Your daddy was Swedish, and your mother, well, she was Swedish more or less, too, though, because she was brought up in Sweden. Right. Did you see any of her German background in her cooking, for instance, or manners? Did she speak German? Yes. They spoke German. Maybe they didn't want us to understand them. I don't know. I understood a little. Did she come with her parents there? No. No, she came with her parents to Sweden. To Sweden, yeah, but you never met her parents, though? No. And your father, was he able to speak German? Yes. Because he spent some time in Germany? Yes. I see. But you never picked up any German? Not much. But your mother, wasn't she interested to let you learn some of the German background? I learned a little bit. Like cooking, for instance? Well, I hate to tell you, she can throw some stuff together without a recipe. When she died, some of those things went. With her? Uh-huh. So you didn't get the ingredients. You didn't know if it was Swedish or German. Well, no, I didn't get the recipe. She threw stuff together. She knew how to do it without looking in a book. For Christmas, for instance, did they celebrate a real Swedish Christmas then? There was nothing German then? Nothing German that I know of. Leipzig and Seel. So she knew how to prepare all that. And I'm doing that, too, on Christmas Eve for my children. I asked them, I said, do you want to come over? Oh, yeah, they said. I thought I could change it because losing two sons makes it so painful, but the others enjoy it, you know. So we just keep it up Christmas Eve. You had lutefisk? Yes, we did. But then we had it until my dad died, and then nobody seemed to like it except me. How about your husband? Was he a lutefisk eater? He didn't care for it that much, did your dad? I think it comes to about $4 or $5 a pound, and we decided that sausage was better, krotof was better. Did your mother make sausage? Yeah, they made that stuff. For Christmas? Sulta, and all that. Oh, Swedish. And you had a Christmas tree then out here? How did you dress the Christmas tree, for instance, in a special manner? Light candles in it? No. No? They might have years ago, but they could, that's dangerous. So there was no candles at all then? No, later on there wasn't any. I do. Mary was a rougher than I, I do. So Santa Claus, he didn't fool you then, in other words, it was a bad joke. No. You were one of the neighbors then? Yes, one of the neighbors, older fella. So during those years, I suppose, Christmas was pretty hard for the parents to keep up with. They always managed to get us something, though. They were very thoughtful. They hung the stockings on the... I don't remember doing that. Do they do that in Sweden? No. We didn't do it either. So how about, you got your gifts on Christmas Eve? Christmas Eve. Nothing in the morning? Nothing in the morning. And then you went to Jyrota? Sometimes. Did you go into Tanden? No, I went to the Messiah Lutheran Church. Oh, they had Jyrota there? Oh, yeah. What denomination is that? Lutheran. Is it Missouri Synod? I think so. And your mother, did she taught you any prayers, for instance, to sit down at the table? Oh, yeah. Saying grace, in Swedish? I might have known in Swedish, but I don't now. No German. No German. But they all passed away from you. So you don't know any German that you can teach your grandchildren? No. Because it's too far off. How about Swedish? Yes, I can. A little bit. What did you teach them? Well, Jo elsker dig. That's very important. No prayers or anything like that? No. Of course, we pray a lot. But not in Swedish? No. In fact, we prayed. My granddaughter and I, I got one that loves, seems to care for Grandma. That's her picture there. And she goes to church, and we prayed in the car before she went in the house last Sunday. She's getting at the age where she's got to keep going straight. There's so many bad things that try to snatch her away, you know. You know, there's so much dope around. There's so much bad things around. She's got to make up her mind now. She's 12. Well, she's almost 13, but make up her mind which direction she's going to go in. So this is when the Grandma and Grandpa is going to have a round? But she's getting away from us, too. You know, children go away, and grandchildren go away, and it's hard. It's hard to take. We might be great grandparents one of these days. You never know. My oldest granddaughter's got a boyfriend. But I don't know if I'm going to be able to keep up with the great-grandchildren like I do the grandchildren. But you didn't have any grandparents. No. Your dad and mom had to carry you all the way. What did they say when you started to date boys? Well, they told me to be in a certain time. I was a very... But to whom to date? Were they particularly... I didn't date a whole lot. See, I was 18 when I got married. Lyle was my second boyfriend, so they didn't have to worry too much. So what did they say then when you brought home Lyle Wilson? It was not the Swanson or Nelson or anything. No. No, my dad put him to work. You was going to check him out immediately. He put him to work over there, building him a house. Ah, I see. He was good at that, wasn't he, Lyle? Yeah, he... Lyle helped my dad, but my dad didn't help us to build this one, you know. No? So you had to do that yourself? Mm-hmm. When you visited Sweden and your cousins over there in Kinnarömma and Borås... And Gothenburg. Also Gothenburg, yeah. How about the nature? Did it tell you anything that your parents had told you about it, like the birches and the lakes? Oh, yeah. They seemed to have a slower pace. Like me, I get hyper and I run around, and they stop and they look at the flowers and they talk. Oh, you noticed that? And they got to have a coffee break in the morning and one in the afternoon, and just fill us full of sandwiches, you know. And my aunt, when I was staying with her, she was old and had dead legs, and she'd come up to my room with sandwiches in the morning, and one morning I snuck down and cooked oatmeal, you know. And they fussed over me, and it was hard to take. I wasn't used to that since my mother died, you know. I wasn't used to that. So they seemed to take a lot of time off. Yeah, they did. Maybe they don't get as hyper as we do, you know. Well, maybe it was because you came as a visitor. Yeah, they were really good. Overdo it a little bit. They were so good. They were so sweet. I appreciate that. End of interview.
