 He had twelve, eleven men and one daughter, with the first wife. Eleven boys and one daughter? Yes. And other marriages? Were you one of them? I was the second married and he had five kids on the second marriage. And there was three girls and two girls. This is Joseph Robert Johnson, who is sitting and telling us. He was born in 1887, March 10th, in Kroksmola, Lindsult, in Karl Malén. He came to America in 1904. Today is April 22nd, 1987. Did you know him before you met her? No. No? No. Kinberg, he was her brother, Karl Kinberg. And he lived on 6th Street, up by the 23rd and 24th Avenue. That's where he lived. He had two boys and... What the heck did he have? He had some girl. Well, that's like... I want... That's hard to remember all this. No. But if we go back now to Sweden... What? If we go back to Sweden, out of Kroksmola... Yeah? You were born there on a farm? Yeah. Your dad had a farm? Yeah, well, a farm... My father was a carpenter, a house builder, a furniture carpenter. He could do almost anything. You were 11 boys. What? You were one of 11 boys. Yeah. Were you one of the older ones or the later ones? I was the latest one. The latest one? Yeah. I was the last one of the whole thing. Uh-huh. And I'm the last one living. The only one living? Yeah. So what happened here now when you got old enough to help out on the farm and help your dad? What? What kind of work were you doing when you started to grow up? Oh, I was doing a little of everything. I was moving sawdust from a saw, a power saw, and I was not more than probably 10 years old. And I had to carry sawdust, and it was raw sawdust, up pretty long way from here and up to the road. Uh-huh. And I had to do that, and I don't think I was over 10 years old. I don't think I was that old. Uh-huh. Was this for your dad? No. What? Oh, that was for somebody else. I see. From my dad, I helped him with, we cut wood, you know, like they used for glass. It was mostly used for melt the glass. Oh, you were the first to use that. Yeah. Oh, yeah. And there was Alsterbro was a glass factory. Alsterbro? Yeah. Did you go there to work also? No, I never worked there. How about your brothers now? What kind of work did they get after they were old enough to? Well, I only had one brother, I mean, that was with the last wife. Yeah. And he do all kinds of things. He went out when he was pretty young too and was out. But how about the other, your real brothers now, because you're? That was my real brother, but the other brothers, they were farmers and worked on the farm and all different places. I see. But your mother died. Huh? Your mother died. What? Your mother, she died. Oh, yes. Vendla Gustava. Yeah. Why did she die? Was she sick for something or do you remember? No, that must have been for old age. Oh, I see. So, I see. Huh? And then your dad remarried. Yeah. Another lady. Yeah. But all the boys he had now, he had 11 boys. Yeah. Did they move away after they were confirmed or what did they stay around there or what did they do? No, I don't know where they were. They disappeared. They were all big when I came to the world, see. I was the last one of the last married. Of the last married? Yes. Oh, I see. And the others was big and most of them probably I saw a few times and they were all out and they were married. And they were married and had families and all that. Do you know if any one of them went to United States, to America? Yes. They did? One of them. Who was that? His name was Carl. Carl. Carl Peterson. Yeah. And he was here in America before I was born, I think. I see. Did you meet him at any time? Oh, yeah. Over here? No. In Sweden? In Sweden. He came back? He came back to Sweden and he bought a farm and he was a farmer. Oh, I see. And I was up there many, many times and helped him. Do you know where he stayed in America then, in Rockford? No, I don't know where he stayed. No? I don't know where he was at all. You never talked about America with him? No. No? Well, I talked about it, but I had two fosters here in America. And he probably was there or someplace else on a farm here in America. Did you meet fosters over here? Yeah. Where did they stay, in Rockford? No, they were in Iowa. Oh, they were farmers there? Huh? They were farmers then? Yeah, they were in Iowa. Do you know where in Iowa? Huh? Do you know where in Iowa? Yeah. One had a farm in Pallet Mountain, Iowa. That's a small farm town. And the other one had a small farm in Dayton, Iowa. This is a bit more north. Yeah. Pallet Mountain. Huh? Pallet Mountain. This close to Swede Bend. Did you visit your foster in Pallet Mountain? Huh? Did you visit your foster in Pallet Mountain? Yeah. Did you go there to see her? Yeah. You did? Yeah. Here he is. Yeah. Yeah. I was there, both of them. And they are both dead now. And there was one had one girl, and the other one had two girls and two boys. And one of the boys, the oldest one, he was a doctor in New York someplace. I never saw him. So you went through school standing in Lindshult? Huh? You went through school standing in Lindshult? Oh, yes. Lindshult. Yeah, Lindshult. How often did you go to school, every other day or every day? No, we had three months of small school a year and three years. And we were in Storskolan, there was four terms and four years. And we only went, let's see, in Storskolan we went fyra månader and four years school. And in Småskolan, det var tre månader och fyra. I don't know. Oh, that's many years ago. Yeah, that's years. And then you went to the pastor for confirmation. Yeah. Do you remember Kyrkoheden's namn? No. You don't? No, I don't remember. In what church was that? That was in Kroksmola. Kroksmola. Yeah. Oh. Yeah. So how many were you when you were confirmed? Many boys and girls, did you go together? No, we went together, but I don't remember how many. It was a big flock, huh? Yeah, that was quite a number. At that time, do you remember if any one of you were talking about America, to go over here? No. There was no talk about that? No, not much. I had two sisters that went to America just in 1802, I think. 1902. Huh? 1902. No, that must have been 1802. No, it was probably. Huh? No, they would be 100 years before. They were too old then. They got to be 1902. A couple of years before you, then. Yeah, that's right. Yeah. It would be 1902. And what was their name? Huh? Was their sisters to you, then, real sisters? Yeah, they was real sisters to me. And the names, do you remember? Well, her name was Elin Petersen. Oh, the other one? And the other one was Emilia Petersen. Emilia. Yeah. So they were older sisters to you? Yeah, they were older. And they left? They left Sweden about a year apart, something like that. Did they go to Iowa or? Yeah. To Iowa? One of them went to Iowa. Elin went to Iowa. She was the youngest. She was next to me, and she was the youngest one. And the other one was Emilia. She was next to the oldest one. Mm-hmm. Yeah. So did they write letters back then to you? Huh? Well, they wrote to my folks, see? They did? Yeah. And you read the letters? And I wrote the letters, because at that time, most of the Swedes didn't know how to write. And they know how to read, but they didn't know how to write. Like your dad now, was he able to read and write? My dad? Yeah. Yeah. And your other two? Yeah, he did. He knew how to read and write, but my mother didn't. She couldn't? She couldn't. She could read, but she couldn't write. So you had to write for her then? Yeah. Mm-hmm. Yeah. So she told you then what to write, and you did it? That's right, yeah. And then one letter you asked to come over? What happened now when you decided to come over here? Now, there was some other thing that come in. My sister, the youngest one next to me, she was up in Iowa to one of the fosters. And then, however, she went to Rockford. I don't know how that happened, but she went to Rockford anyhow, and she got married here and had two or three kids, three, four kids. I guess they were, but they're all gone now. All gone. Yeah. So how did you come to think about going over now then? One way was that I didn't like to go and transfer. Military? Military. Why was that? A lot of people didn't like that. What was the reason? Well, the reason was they had to spend that time, see? They didn't get paid, any pay for that time. Yeah, but you didn't get paid too much to work either. No. I mean, there was no choice. No, they had to do it when their age came. You couldn't just... They was around 19, 20. 20. Yeah, well, when you were 20, yeah. Yeah. When most of your friends then, most of your friends in your age group, they didn't go to the service then, or did they do it? Well, no. They didn't. Did they serve then, most of your friends? Oh, yeah, they served. What did they say then when they... What did they tell you when they came back? Did they like the military service or did they scare you for it? No. I don't know what you mean by that. In other words, a lot of young people at that time, you know, they didn't want to go into the military. Yeah. So there must have been someone that tried it and came back and said there's no good. No, they must have... I had some that... Well... How about your brothers now? Did they serve in the military? No. No one? No. No. Did they go over here then? Well, not the one that I had. He was... I don't know how he got through with the military service, but he was in it. No? Some way he got out of it. And I can't tell you how, because I don't remember. I don't remember. So what did you do now then? Did you write to your sister to tell her to send a ticket or did you have money to buy the ticket? No, no. They had wrote to me and asked me if I wanted to go to this. Oh, I see. And I said yes and some other relations I had up in Iowa sent for me then. And I said it's fine because I didn't want to go into military service. And that's how that happened. What kind of work were they offering you now? Did they tell you they could get a job for you or... Where? From here to the United States? No, they didn't say anything. They sent a ticket to you? Yeah, they sent a ticket and they didn't ask what I could do or anything because I worked on the farm first when I came here. So what happened? About a year or so. When you went to the pastor now to get the Fritningsbuttiget? Well, they didn't say anything. You didn't? No. But there were a lot of young people that left during that time? No. They didn't care, I guess. Were you the only one from Krogsmola that left? Yeah. You didn't have anyone with you? No. You were alone? Yeah. Oh, wait a minute. No, my brother was with me. He was with you also? Yeah, he was with me. He was with you. What was his name? Huh? What was his name? Edward. Edward. Mm-hmm. Edward Tettesen. Oh, he was a little bit older than you or? Yeah, he was older. He was quite a bit older. So your sister or sisters had to send two tickets to Krogsmola? No, there was a farmer in Iowa that sent me the ticket. Oh, he sent a ticket? Yeah, and then I worked on the farm, worked it all out on the farm. I worked the whole summer for $64. Crowns? Yeah. Oh, you've been in Sweden? Yeah. Sexty-fira kronor? No, here in Iowa. In Iowa, yeah. But how much? In America. How much money were you making in Sweden of working on the farm? Oh, uh... Were you able to save anything? Well, no, not much. I forgot just how much I had a month. God, I never... But if you look back now, would it have been possible for you to buy the ticket yourself? No. You had no money? No. And your dad, he couldn't... No, he had all he could do to feed the... The family. Yeah. So when you worked on your own after you were confirmed, then you were out working for farmers and others. Yeah. Could you keep that money you made then during that time, or did you have to pay your dad something for it? No, I didn't pay the dads anything. You didn't? No, more than what I gave them. You could keep that money, but it was not much? No, you see, I was only 16, 17, 18 years old. Oh, you were a full-grown man then? Huh? You were a full-grown man then? Yeah, oh yeah. You were expected to work like a regular man? Yeah, and I worked on the farm too. Oh, did you like the farm life? Oh, well, even if I didn't, I had to do something. No choice? No. I had to help my dad too, and we were cutting wood for glass factories, you know, they had... For the furnaces? The best wood they could get was pine, pine and that kind of trees. But they couldn't use birch? Yeah. They didn't use birch? Huh? Bjerg? No, bjerg was not quick. Oh, I see. That was more for heat, but that was not quick burning. The glass factory wanted something that burned fast so the glass could be gone fast. And that's how... they had plenty of pine trees that grows up big fields. So when you and Edward left your home, what did your dad say then, or your mother? What did they say? I don't know what they said that I can't remember. I was the only one of them all that was here in America that was home one time. The only one? That was 1910. So after six years you went home? Yeah. So you made enough money then to... Yeah. Let us begin now, do you remember the boat you went on? Yeah, I did. You went down to Copenhagen? I did remember the boat, but what the heck was it? I don't remember then. You went over to England? Yeah, there was a smaller boat from Gothenburg to England. And then they had a boat... I can't remember the name of it now. Maybe it comes later. So how was the accommodations on the boat? It was the first time you were on your own. Yeah. Did you like the boat trip? Yeah. It was not too sick. Yeah, the only thing was when we was about, I think, four or five days out, the boat stopped and started off again. And I was wondering what the heck was happening. And then they said there was an iceberg floating in the ocean. So they had to stop and go around some way. I don't know how they done it, but that's the way they told me. So you and Edward were the only ones from the community that you knew on the boat? Yeah. Were there a lot of people on the boat? Oh, God, yes. It was all full of people. And then you came to New York and Ellis Island. Yeah, New York. And Ellis Island. Huh? And Ellis Island. Yeah. Did you have any problems there at Ellis Island? No. No problems? No, no problem. You said you were going to a farmer in Iowa and they let you through? Yeah. And then you came on a train? Yeah. All the way to Iowa? All the way from... You went to Clinton, Iowa, or...? To Dayton. Dayton. Dayton, Iowa. That's a farm town. And the train stopped right there? Yeah. Yeah, that was pretty good size town. That's not too far from Boxholm. Huh? That's not too far from Boxholm, Iowa. No, I don't... You don't remember that town? I think Boone was the closest. Boone, yeah, that's south of it. Yeah. Yeah, and... Harcourt, Boxholm, Fort Dodge? No, no. The biggest town in Iowa. Des Moines. Des Moines. Yeah. Yeah, that one, Des Moines. You went down there too? Yeah. That was not too far from there. So you and your brother, now, you stayed there with your sister in Dayton? No. I... You stayed there for a few days before you went south? I stayed with my foster's daughter. She was married, and he had a farm to work. So I stayed by them. And that was one of them. And the other foster, she had a bigger farm. And we were two hired fellows there to work that farm. And their son, he had a son and two daughters. He had two sons and two daughters. And once, now, the son, he was a doctor in New York. I never saw him. So I don't know who he was. So you started to work there for them immediately? Huh? You started to work there for them? Oh, yeah. And your sister's daughter, she spoke Swedish? Yeah. Was she able to speak Swedish? Your niece? Your sister's daughter? Yeah. She understood Swedish, though? Yeah, they understood Swedish, but they could never... Was she married to a Swede? Yeah. No. No? No. My sister wasn't. So you had to learn to speak English then? Yeah. Quite fast? Yeah. So how did that come about now? Did you have any problems? It took a little time. When I went away from Iowa, I didn't know too much. English? English, I mean. But the Swedish, they couldn't fool me on Swedish. No? Because I went through just schools and... How was the work now then, to work on an American farm compared to a Swedish? Oh, that was just about the same. There was different grain here and like... Corn? Corn and all kinds of different things they done here. And they didn't have any forest or any wood or anything? Did you have to cut any woods in the winter? No. How long did you stay on this farm? Oh, just about... Pretty close to a year, I guess. A year? So you stayed over the winter then? Yeah. When did you leave Sweden? In the spring or in the fall? That was in the spring. In the spring? Yeah. In the spring in... I think it was April or May or something. I can't remember. Then I was home one time too. You stayed there a year then, you said, and then you left for Rockford. Yeah. How come you went to Rockford? Did you know anybody here then? Your sister or... I was going to see my sister. Just for a visit? Yeah. And then you stayed here? Yeah. So you came here to Rockford in 1905? Four. 1904? Five. 1905? Yeah. 19... How was it... How was Rockford at that time? It looked different than it is today. Oh, yeah. Much different. No cars on the streets? Oh, they had a... Let's see. Did they have the streetcars? I guess they did. I guess they did. Down on Kishwaukee or State Street? No, they had on State Street that was running up to Shaw Street. That's where they had to turn around the tank to give the streetcar power, the trolley. And that's where all the streetcars stopped. But if that was when I first came here, then I don't know. I can't really remember hardly anything. I know we had a dinner in a restaurant on West State Street, close to the... Well, down there by the courts, Courthouse. It was on the West Side there? It was on the West Side. But at that time they said there were no Swedes on the West Side. They stayed on the East Side. They said at that time the Swedes stayed on the East Side. Oh, yes. And the Irish on the West Side. Yeah. There was a dividing line there. Yes, yeah. You didn't dare cross the bridge? No. So how did you find Rockford now? Did it look good to you? They're all talking Swedish here. Yeah, yeah. You know, the 7th Street? Yeah. We got off downtown, you know, where Northwest and Illinois Central were. I think I came where Weston Railroad was instead of Illinois Central. We come from the high top there on South Main Street, you know. How about your brother Edward now? Did he go with you? Yeah, he went with me. So you quit your job then in Iowa? Yeah. And came here to Rockford? Yeah. And he was with me that time. So your sister, she was living in Rockford then? Yeah, both of them. My Eileen, she was married and she had a kid and a boy. I don't know. And he was a male. Worked on a post office some, after he got bigger. How about 7th Street now? Was there Snusgatan? Oh yeah. 7th Street. 7th Street, that was about the same as it is now. Maybe they had a little lower houses there on 4th Avenue. I see. They had a bunch of them there, but then they built that big. On 7th Street then at that time, on 4th Avenue, there were all Swedish stores there and businesses. Oh yeah. You could go any place on the East Side, put in an errand and talk Swedish. So it was just like coming home then? Yeah. So how about your brother now? Did you look for a job then here or how did you get a job? Yeah, I looked for a job. And what kind of? Well, I got a job in a glass factory and I was out on 20th Street, I believe, just a little south of Broadway. There was an old factory, a furnace factory there that I got the first job in Rockford. I see. And there was a glass beveling outfit that they used for the furniture, more beveled glasses and mirrors and put that in different cases of furniture. And that's where I started and I got a dollar and a quarter a day at that time. At that time. And no unions? No. How about your brother now? What kind of work? How about your brother? Yeah. Where did he start working? Well, he started in a place where they bent glass, different shapes. So he started in the same factory then? No, no. He started up where 11th Street and Railroad Avenue and stuff like that. So they bent the glass. They used many times kind of glass that was half bent. Of cabinets? Yeah. And he worked there for a little while. I guess made pretty good money there. How did you live now? Did you rent a room, both of you together? No, I lived by my sister first when I came to Rockford. And she lived on 4th Avenue, 7th Avenue and 10th Street. And Rue Sien had a grocery store in the corner and there was a meat market also there. And we had a corner on the other side, 7th Avenue there. So my sister, she lived upstairs in a double house. And I lived there for a while. And then my brother-in-law told me, he said, you better move because my mama is going to have another baby. So I had to look for another room. And now where that was now that I got that I don't remember. I had, I lived on 13th Avenue and 7th Street. And I lived on 5th Avenue between 12th and 13th Street. And I lived on 6th Avenue and 10th Street. And 7th, 15th, 7th, 7th Avenue and 9th Street. So how long did you keep this first job in the glass factory there? I had to keep that for quite a while. I, after a while, then that was hard time. And that was 1907. Those were hard times then? Yeah. Do you mean they cut your wages? Yeah. You could, you worked when they had anything to do and then they send you home. After they had a job, they were going to have out, then they call us back. So that was done and then they laid us off again. And you were not able to get another job somewhere else? No, that was hard to get a job. How about the furniture factories? You never looked into a job there? Yes, I was in there. I was working at... Landstrom? No. Republic? No. Emerson, Emerson factory. That's on 11th Street and out there by the railroad tracks there. Uh-huh. Yeah, and I didn't. How did they pay compared to the other jobs? Oh, they didn't pay much. They didn't? No. I got something like two and a quarter a day or something like that. No, but you made only a dollar and a quarter in the other one. Uh-huh. You made only a dollar and a quarter in the other job. Yeah. Was it an easier job though? No. That was not an easy job, but that's the way it was. That's the way it was, huh? Yeah, and you had a trade when you worked there so long, you know. How about... What did you eat now? In the restaurants or... No, well, I... You fixed your own food? I ate sometimes where I lived. Oh, I see. You boarded then? Yeah. Boarding room. Sometimes not. You didn't stay down at Eastman's Hotel? Yeah. Did you stay at Eastman's? No, Eastman's Hotel wasn't there. It wasn't there then? No. Oh, they came later? Yeah. You were far ahead of them, huh? Oh, yeah. So then 1910, you decided to take a trip back to Sweden? Yeah. Did your brother go with you? No. No, nobody went with me. So you had saved up then enough money so you could go home? Yeah. Did you put the money in the bank and took them out then? Yeah. I bought a lot on Silver Hill. With Alabama? Yeah. How did you get to that one? Did you read it in the paper or...? Yeah. And then when I bought the cigar store on 7th Street, I paid the fellow that land I got in Silver Hill for his store. So you traded? For his store, yeah. Maybe there was a bad deal. I mean, you should have kept the land. Well, it was good enough for me at that time because... Were there quite a few people here in Rockford that invested in Silver Hill? Yeah, there was quite a few. They went down there? Yeah. Did you talk to anybody that came back? No. So you don't know if it was good land down there or not? No. No. There was... We had a lot, Silver Hill. And you never saw the place? No. I never saw it. How did they sell the land now to you? How did they describe it to you? Well, that's a thing... They sounded good? They always do, you know. The agents, they got a lingo like everything else, you know, so they can sell something. And I had a little money left over from my work, and I thought, I might just as well put it in there. How much did you pay for it? I don't know. I don't remember what it was. It wasn't too much, but it was enough, so... I paid probably $800. That's not much. Something like that. And they say that land down there, there are no mosquitoes. Beautiful climate. Yeah. You can raise bananas and anything you want. Yeah. Well, that I don't remember, but there was something like that. But you don't remember anybody that came back and told you exactly what happened down there? No. I tried to sell it a couple times. Did you buy it with the intention to go down there and settle? No. I bought it for speculation. They came in handy then with the cigar store. Yeah. So what happened with him? Did he move down there? Huh? The one that had the cigar store, did he move down there? I don't know where he was. He was named... Was he a Swede? Yeah. He was a Swede. He had a fellow making cigar in the back room. So you took over the whole business? Yeah, but I didn't take that over because he wasn't there at that time. Yeah, but you were not experienced to handle... You were not experienced though? No. I didn't have no experience, but I... How did you go about though? Did you hire somebody or... Well, I had money enough to pay for the... Help? The store and the help. I figured that if I could get somebody to help me, I would. So I took a fellow by the name of Larson to help me. And he didn't pay me a cent. So, but I was glad I had somebody to help me. You mean you took him as a companion? Yeah. He made a good deal then? Yeah, he made a good deal. He bought a house and he got married. He got married about the same way. He went to Sweden and going home, here, back home, he found a girl that he liked pretty good and he got married. And they have two, three children. What year did you buy this cigar store? On 7th Street. Yeah, what year? That was before you went to Sweden? 1912. Oh, that was after you'd been to Sweden then? Yeah. And you were not married then? No. So, but if we go back now, you bought a ticket then to go back to Sweden? Yeah. That was only for a visit? Yeah. You didn't have the intention to stay in Sweden? No, no. Only to go home and... Go home and see my folks. So how did you dress up now? Did you have a watch then with your gold band around here? Huh? Yeah, I still got it. You still got it? Yeah, I got that on the safety box. So, how different were you dressed now when you came home 1910 to Kroksmola? Huh? What did you differ in your dress compared to the people back home in Kroksmola? How differently were you dressed? Oh, like they were dressed here? Yeah, but to compare to Swedes though, you look much better. You look like a wealthy man. Yeah. You went to church there on Sunday and... Yeah, church and a necktie and all that stuff. Oh, you were all snazzy up? Oh, yes. Well, had to be nice. And then people said, there come a Svenska Amerikaner. Yeah. Yeah, and I'm... Joseph Pettersson. Yeah, and he invited me over to places that I... Never seen before? Never. They opened the door? Yeah, they opened the door. How about the girlfriends now? Huh? How about the girlfriends now? Did you meet them? The what? The old girlfriends. Oh, there wasn't very many left. What happened to them? They were out. Already married? Trying to get jobs or out somewhere else, you know. There was nothing more. You didn't meet too many then of your old... No, I didn't meet very many. Old friends. I met a few of them and I stayed home for about three months. So what did you tell people now? You said it's pretty good over in Rockford or... Yeah, well, I had to say something. Yeah, but I mean, compared to Sweden at that time, it was much, much better here in Rockford. Yeah? Oh, yeah. It was better. Yeah? Because in Sweden at that time, you didn't have cold and hot water in the houses. No, no. You didn't have... But here in Rockford, you still had hot houses though. Oh, yes. You started, I guess. How about the bathtub? Did they have bathtubs in the house? Bathtub? Yeah. Yeah, they had that. In most of the houses. Yeah, they had a bathtub in most of the houses. But no washing machines. No washing machines. It was only the board. Yeah, that's right. Did you take your wash to the Chinese or who washed your clothes? No, my sister washed my clothes. Oh, she was the washing machine. Yeah, she was a little more. I see. Yeah. How about your brother, now, Edward? Did he go with you to Sweden or...? No, nobody did. You went alone? I was the only one that went. When you went back home in 1910, you didn't look for a farm or anything to stay in Sweden to get married or...? No, I never intended to do that. What kind of work did you have then when you left 1910? I was working in the glass factory, beveling glass. The same one? Yeah. As you got the first. Yeah, and I got... They had... So, you... You... They had a... I can't... They started to organize, so they had organized for... The union? Union, yeah. Oh, it was early 19... Yeah, and the glass factory, they had piecework. Piecework for an inch. Your bevel was one inch, most of them, and wide, and then all around the glass. Oh. And you got so much, I forgot just how much, and you had to be careful. I forgot just how much, and I was... I had a pretty good job there. Then I was head smoulder, so I got pretty good money. Sometime we worked a little overtime, and sometime I made as much as $5 a day. And I was in 1910, 1914. So, you didn't care too much about the union coming in then? Huh? You didn't care too much about union coming in then? Yeah, well... Did you join the union? Yes. You did? But how about the management? Did they like the union? Well, they didn't have any against that union, but I belonged to the machinist union. There you had a harder job to... Organize. Organize, and there was not much good in a machine shop, because some machine shops would have a pretty good thing when they had a union, but most of them didn't. Do you remember when you visited Sweden in 1910, they had a big strike in Sweden in 1909? A general strike. Yeah. Did people talk about that? Oh, hell yes. Yeah, they did? Oh, yes. A lot of people came from Sweden at that time, you remember? Yeah. It was a bad strike there. Yeah, yeah. And then they came over here. Yeah. And the union would be all right if it was honest, produced, or honest people that... Controls it. Would control it, and would control it the right way, but they always wanted to get too much for too little, you know. And they don't help anybody. I don't care what it is, because if a person can do more than he does, that's waste. And I say that too much waste, union is too much waste, and too much demanding stuff that don't amount to worth a heck. And so I don't care for union myself. When you came into Rockford, did you join any church? No. No. You didn't go to any other Swedish churches? No, I never did that, because I figured if I want a drink, I am going to front door to get one. And I figured that if I belong to the church, I couldn't do such a thing at that. Well, they were against drinking then? Yeah. There's a lot of church members, they are still drinking. Oh yes, yeah. But you wanted to be fair. You wanted to be clear. Yeah, I wanted to. From everything like that. Yeah. So you never belonged to a church then? No, I didn't. How about your wife now then? Well, she didn't belong to church either. Never belonged to church? No, either one of us, but we had kids to go to church. I think both the kids were going to church here when they were growing up. To the Lutheran church or Covenant or Free Church? Yeah, well, they had a church on Washington Street. Oh, the Covenant? Yeah. On Washington? Yeah, yeah. And the state? Yeah, they wanted me to join it, but I didn't join it, because I figured that I take care of myself and the church members take care of themselves. What year did you marry? That was during the war. The first war? Yeah. I was married in the summertime. We went in Chicago. I had a restaurant in Iraq on 7th Street at that time. Oh, you did? Yeah, and I called it the Viking Restaurant. It was on 2nd Avenue and 7th Street. I don't know what it's in there now, but I had the upstairs and the upstairs for rooming house and downstairs for a restaurant. I was there until I had to go in the Army. And you were married then when you ran the restaurant? Yeah. I married when I'd run the restaurant. So you were married about 1916 or something like that? Does this sound right? Yeah, I guess so. Who married you? Did you go to Justice and Peace? Yeah, Justice and Peace in Chicago. In Chicago? Yeah. So you had to be drafted then? Huh? You had to be drafted then in the Army? Yeah. Here you came from Sweden, you tried to avoid the draft in Sweden and here you came right into it? Yeah. Do you remember though, there was a big parade here in Rockford? Yeah. And a lot of Swedes. Yeah. And they were apprehended by the police and sent to Chicago for a whole year. Yeah. Do you remember that? No, I don't. There was the Socialists. Oh, yeah. You don't remember that? No, I don't remember that. Yeah, they resisted the draft and they were taking prisoners to Chicago for a whole year. Oh. You don't have any idea, the remembrance of that? No, no. I know many that skipped Rockford and went to Canada. To Canada? Yeah. Oh, I see. To get away from the draft. Oh. Did they go back to Sweden, some of them too? Oh, I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I never seen any of them. No, I don't know. I don't know. I never seen any coming back from Canada either, so I don't know. But you don't remember anything about the Swedes? No, I don't. Do you remember Herman Hallström? Yeah. He was one of them, you know, was agonizing them. Yeah, he was in the army. But he was a Socialist. Yeah, and he was in the army. Yeah, he was. And trained when I was in the army. Oh, he was? Oh, yes. You went together? No, we wasn't together. In the same outfit? Yeah, I know him well. I know him pretty well. He was a Socialist, you know. Yeah, he was a Socialist. He was a Socialist, all right. And Ogryn was another one. Ogryn, you remember him? Who? Ogryn. Ogryn, yeah. He was much older. Yeah, yeah.
