 I grew up on Stone Zone. And I grew up there the last two years. Big, long stone. Eighteenth square or thirty-six inches square. First I couldn't even lift for it. And I've been there about a month working. I took one of the big ones on the east arm and walked with him. And I walked up on a long ladder to grease that thing up way on top. How's your windmill? Look, eight by eight or ten by ten timber with pins nailed across. That was all there was. And I run up there like a cat. Fell on the sidewalk in the business street. Lay there and he froze to death. In Chicago? Yeah. So he was drunk? Well, he was here many times from Chicago. He died. So he was drunk? Yeah, well, let's see, he was about forty years old or something when that happened. He was the son of a gunner guy. He was the one place that had the wrestling, you know. And the other man never showed up so they asked anybody in the crowd if they would go up and wrestle with that man. My brother did. He did? Yeah, he licked them too. I say, han var stark han? Well, that's a long time ago. Yeah, he told my brother he had a girlfriend when he was here one time. I don't know if he was married or not, I don't think so. Victor Pettersson, he was born on the 5th of December 1887 in Jämmersta by, before Öland, and came to America in 1906. Today is the 2nd of October 1986. He was a pretty good guy. Tell us a little bit about what your father did at home in Öland. What? What did your father do at home in Öland? My father was a farmer. He had a big nice farm. And we had that, they called it skurvark. You know, we had one, two, we drove with axes around home. And ground up stone and we shipped them to Stockholm, Sweden. And we brought them down for floors, you know, in big buildings. Yeah. Like a glass, put sand and water on them. And that big thing I worked on, I worked by Sandviken. Next to the sea, about 50 feet from the sea. The Baltic Sea? No, the Swedish Sea there. Östersund? No, Västersund. They run between Småland and Öland. And they build a bridge way down on one end across the sea. From Kalmar? To Kalmar, yeah. It's the longest bridge in the world. And you can drive over there with anything. And they're so high up, a ship can go under there. With a mast, you know. I've never seen it, but that's the way I read it. They were working on it when we were over there in the 1990s. You went to school there? Oh yeah, I went to school for seven years. Every day or every other day? Every day. I had a long way to walk. It was a couple of miles, I know. How did you end up going to America in 1906? I just got here. On your own? Yeah. And I take them to court and I have to tell them everything. And I got my papers and everything. So I'm an American citizen. Where did you get the ticket? Did you buy it in Kalmar or where did you buy the ticket? I got it from the court. Yeah, but I mean in Sweden. Oh. The ticket to come over. Yeah, I think I bought it in, not Kalmar. Borgjorm? No, no. I would go across the sea and get it. It was a place where a lot of planes come and go and boats and everything. It was the last city there. What is the name of that? That's a big, nice city. Göteborg? Yeah, that's where it was. Oh, you went over there? Yeah. And it was 1906? Yeah, even a naked woman standing in the windows when you walk on the street. I've never seen anything like it. But you were not interested? No. And we went from there to England. We stayed there four nights, sleeping in a hotel, you know. And that hotel was full of lice. They put, they eat me up. When I got out on the ocean, on the ocean boat, I went and took a bath and I took some clean clothes on. And still the devils were sitting in the skin. So I got so close to America, I saw the land on America. And I took a suitcase and filled all the clothes with lice in the ocean. When I got to Rockford, I never had a lice scent. Never? Never had? No sir. So you threw them overboard? Yeah. Suitcase and all? Ain't that funny? That was horrible. What was the name of the boat? Viking, no. The Canadian? Viking or something. Viking. I think so. It was in Stockholm or Liverpool. No, he went to London or Liverpool. It was in Liverpool you got the lice? I got lice in England. In Liverpool? England in the hotel. That was always for family. How did you get through Ellis Island with lice? I didn't have a lice when I came to Rockford. Ellis Island? Not scents either. I even worked at a necking company here in Rockford. Where they make socks and stuff like that. John Nelson? Yeah. John Nelson necking company? Yeah, the face of the Rock River down there. To Chicago. To Chicago. I took a bus from there to Rockford. You took the train? Plane. Train? Plane. Oh, plane. And I had guys here in Rockford I know I stayed there a week. I got a job and I worked. And your brother in Chicago, was he already there then or he came later? Huh? Oh no, I was the first one. You were the first one? Yeah, the rest come on down. What did your father say when you left home? Did he like it when you left? My father? Yeah. What did he say? Well, I wrote him letters and all and I never been home. Never been home? No, sir. But what did your father say when you left home in 1906? He took me down to, let's see, the other side of Boy Horns, two miles, there's another city down there. So I got the boat there. You know, that's all. And I walked two miles to Boy Horns. And then, yeah, and then my father got me. Oh, they have a long time, you know. He can't remember everything. He's a legacy. But I'm fine right now. You're fine? Yes. I can almost knock down anybody. I was a real fighter. I lived five miles in Chicago, had nothing but fight. In Chicago? Yeah. Gabla crooks. Yeah, I lived towards Sconing. Yeah. So you were a Svenskar? I was a Svenskar. Yeah, a lot of fun there. They were nice people. They had three kids. And one time they had sent to New York for a sneezing partner. So I bought the whole outfit they had, you know. And I had a bunch of time with that. I went from Chicago. I lived down in, let's see, Maywood. And I was alone a little three blocks away. The name was John Gold. He was a German. And I come in there one night, and they had a big front door, you know, to open. And there was a big glass to cover the door on the other side so you couldn't see. And he had one big German shepherd in there. It was his and his wife sitting there on the floor. And John Gold, he was a bartender. So I come inside the door, I put a little bit on my hand like that. And the dog sneezed. She sneezed. He sneezed. I never sneezed. What the hell couldn't I sneeze when I had it right up to my mouth and nose and everything? But you blew it away, though? Yeah, I blew it, yeah. You didn't get it? Yeah. You mean you made a living on that? No, no. I worked in an American can company. In Chicago? Yeah. Yeah, it was a nice place to work. And every noon we was out wrestling and muck around, you know. I was a kid then. I liked that job, fight. And one time a guy, a German guy, he claimed I took his girlfriend away. I never did. I talked to her, but that's all. So we got in a fight, you know. Right on Main Street in Maywood. And I knocked his eyes closed with my fist. And he had black eyes for three months. You were safe then. He couldn't find you. So I had to walk home. Crazy things. You know kids are kids. I'm no kid no more. I don't fight now. I like friends. And living peace and comfort. That's what I like. And you never get any damage? I mean your nose is still straight and... Everything. No problems? You know, first I hit him in the stomach hard. So you went bent over? And he got an uppercut, you know. And then bang, bang, bang on his eyes and face, you know. And he never got a chance to hit you back? No. You were fast then. I was okay. And then your brother was there also. My brother, he was a strong man. I was not strong. Was he stronger than you? I think so. He had big muscles. He took a wrestler and won. He was called from the crowd, you know, if anybody would go up and wrestle with a man. Because the other one was supposed to come, he never showed up. Yeah. It's hard to believe though, but I have to believe it. And that was before you were married, all this? Yeah. I've been married twice. Oh, I see. Yeah. And I got one hanging around me all the time now. I don't want to see her. I want to stay the way I am. But you never lost a girl in a fight though? No. Never? No. I was pretty good, but that's a hard game, boy. Yeah. Were you in Rockford during the First World War? There were some Swedish guys that were arrested, you know, and sent to Bridewell in Chicago, but they didn't want to go. I was here. I was working for Sunstrance. At that time? Yeah. And they claimed, they claimed examination for me, so they need me so bad in the shop and do work for big bases and stuff. They're on a great big high machine. It was two feet below the floor, floor service, so the crane couldn't go over it. And they don't want to lose me. So you were not drafted then? I wasn't drafted, no. We're talking about World War II now. Yeah. Oh, there was World War II. How about World War I? Huh? The First World War. Yeah, the First World War. Who the heck were they fighting with, though? Well, there was with Germany, you know, in the First World War. No, there was a war before that. Well, there was the Philippine War, Teddy Roosevelt, but you were not here then. No. But there was the war. That was the war when the Kaiser was in Germany, the Kaiser. Yeah, going. The sons and sons took care of it. The big factory where I worked. But there was the Second World War, though, where you worked. No, no, there was the First. The First. First World War, no. And then there was a war with Germany and those. And then there was the Third War. The American War seems to win all the time. Yeah? Yes, sir. They never lost a war. But you don't remember Herman Hallstrom as a mayor in... No. You don't remember him? Who? Hallstrom. Hallstrom, where was he? He was a mayor in Rockford. Oh, yeah, yeah. Sure you remember him. I remember him, Hallstrom. Hallstrom was a mayor is what you named after him. Yeah, this over there. He was a Swede. Yeah. And there was another mayor, too, after him. Blum. Blum, yeah. Which one was best? Hallstrom, he was one of the best. He was one of the best? Yeah, he was a good mayor. That's how we got all these good streets around us. And that street, you got that. I've been to Swedish Club this morning. Oh, Switzer? Switzer, yeah. I belong to Swedish Club in Chicago, too. So I transferred from Chicago to here. Did you join any church when you came here? No. No? I joined the church 26 years when I joined Switzer Club, all. Yeah. So you never went to the church then? You didn't join that? Oh, I've been going to church a long time ago, but not lately I haven't. I got the church on the TV and everything. Every time you go there, they want some money. I'll pass a hat around, four or five dollars or so. Be kind of expensive there, huh? Yeah. But you go to the club then every morning? No, no, no. No? Oh, two or three times in a week. I got a guy there, a ride with, he's meant to go with them. And he is my chauffeur man, and I pay him $30 a month. Oh, you have a... With that I ride a couple, three times a week. That's a lot of money. But it's good service, though. Yeah. You got a new car. I had two Cadillacs, new ones. Oh, you had the Cadillacs? Yeah. I had about over 20 new cars in my life. 20? 20, yeah. When did you buy your first one? Let me see. There was an old automobile, no, not old automobile, Dutch. The first one you bought? Yeah, that was a dirty car. Every Saturday I come from work, I take the goddamn pan off underneath and the shins, there was a, what do you call it, a chain. They got loose all the time. And they bang, bang when you went over 40 miles an hour, you can hear it, bing, bang, bing, bang, and so on. I bought about six Buicks, an automobile, I think about six, seven of them. And they were always new when you bought them? Yeah. Always new? Yeah. So you made pretty good money then? Oh, yeah. I'm no poor man. Even during the Depression you made it, you worked all the time? I wanted you to go downstairs with me. Yeah, we do that later. Below there. We take him with. We take him with. You go over, Sonny? You have your records. I call him Sonny, he like that, you know. Your neighbor? Yeah. I got a neighbor next door, he's a son of a gun. He throw all kinds of crap with his garage wall. And next to my fence, I had him to paint the fence all around. It looked nice there. Yeah, that's what I told him, it looks very nice around here. You keep it neat and nice. So you have done a lot of work here for the house then? Yes, I have. I work at night. My wife and I, we put one ceiling and one night together. So you had one son with the first Judith from Pearsons? Yeah. And then you married the second one, Delia? We never had no kids. She was from Pearsons also, close to the first one? Yeah, she was pretty young. And one morning, I fried crop caulker. And I brought out two or three halves of nice crop caulker. And I gave it to her on a plate and I went and cleaned up in the kitchen. When I come back, her eyes are turned inside out. Had to take her to the hospital and he died. Was she your second wife? Yeah. She got a head, what do you call that? Bang their heads up or something? Yeah. Hendrix or something. Yeah, she died. And I've been alone since. But you worked at Sundstrand's then as a tool and dye maker? Yeah, Sundstrand's a make. How were you able not to learn all this new? Because you didn't know that when you came from Irland? No, I learned that here. Well, you were shaping stones there, or planing there too. When I was a little kid, though, I went to a place to buy stuff for carpenting. And my father didn't know that. I didn't have no money to pay for it. So I gave my father's name and I bought planers and every small thing, you know. I made a wagon. A wagon with spokes, wheels, out of wood. I never seen a wagon like that. I made that so nicely. And a little bit more other stuff than I made, you know. My hand work. So I've been a mechanic since I was born. So it was easy for you then to come into Sundstrand's and work like that? Yeah, I got a job there. A good thing I did. They put me $575 a month. For pension? Pension. So it was a good union? Yeah. You belonged to the union then? Well, I suppose I do, but I've never been in there for 50 years. They're all union. Yeah. And I got $875 for the government. See, I make more money this way and I was working. That's why I can do a little bit, you know. That's why you had 16 Buicks and Cadillacs and 5 Oldsmobiles? Yeah, I had 20 new cars. And one lemon, the Dodge. Yeah. You never bought the Dodge again? I had another car. I can't remember the name. They quit making it. And the cops had them for a while. And I can't remember the name. It was so beautiful. DeSoto. Huh? DeSoto. DeSoto? That could probably be it. When you step on it, you saw your hair was... Shhh. It go like a shot. It was a good car? Yeah, wonderful car. What the hell did they stop making them cars for? It was better than the car the rest of them. Yeah. Shhh. They went broke. You said. They made them too good. Too good, yeah. Yeah. One time... A girlfriend? Yeah. And we was out driving around, you know, close to Lake Delvin. And it was a beautiful road, straight and nice. I step on my car all the way down. We went 130 miles an hour. And I couldn't stand to drive any faster, because then I would drive in the gutter someplace. So I stopped. 130 miles an hour. What make a car was that? I would say, you know... Buick? I don't know. That could be Oldsmobile. The big one. I think that was the one. And then you had two speed boats also? Three. Three? Yeah. Well, I only had 35 high motor on it, in part. Regular boats? But they went with an awful speed. And I had three girls with me one time. And one of them wanted to go to shore and take a leak, you know. She said, part of the boat. I had to laugh. So you had an easy time to get girls then, with you in the new cars and new boats? I drove the boat up to the shore, you know, so she could get off. She could get off and she come back. Well, we all have to take a... So you went up to Minnesota to work for a French farmer, you said? Yeah. One day we decided to go out and shoot prairie shakers. And there was some coming from Crookston. There was two or three, I don't know, but they had two dogs with them. And them dogs, you know, one of them says, you lay there and rest. So he didn't bother, but the other dog did. He sneezed them up, you know. When he got them used so far, then he made signs with his tail. Watts, watts. And we shot down all of them. I think there were 30 or 40 of them in the bunks. Altogether we shot 500 prairie shakers. That's impossible. Yeah. Is that true? That is true. But the prairie shaker had nothing to do with it. They had thrown some away. They got too old. Ain't that horrible? Yeah. You never hunted since? No. I had a nice gun. And I sold that gun. There was, I don't know how many shot there were, you see. There were plenty of them. Let me see now. Oh my goodness. And that guy that lived with me for a while, he was over in Minneapolis. He come here and he got it. And I got his dead a long time ago. Yeah. And I went out myself and I shot some other birds, you know. Nice gun, repeater. Yeah. Cost a lot of money. You just touch the trigger and off they went. I just shot three or four birds, big birds, I don't know. And I had my wife's brothers for a party after I'm dead. I lived on South Street in Rockford there, close to Seventh Street, a railroad there. Yeah. So when you worked as a farmer up in Minnesota, was he a Frenchman? Minnesota, I worked for a farmer. For a farmer there. And from there when I quit, they had to sleep in the barn. Was that during the Depression? Yeah, yeah. Well, I don't know, that was 1924. Oh, I see, that was before then. Yeah, I think they all slept, even three of us. We slept in the barn. And it was nice sleeping there. And then one day we decided to go out for hunting, you know. And I happened to see I got them, what do you call them son of a bitches, you know, that pee on you, you stink like a skunk. I shot the skunk. And I threw it up in the car, you know, the boxcar. Yeah. And I smelled skunk all that time when I was up there. So when I got back home I threw those clothes away, I put other clothes on. Skunk, skunk. And the dog was trying to chase it and he was laying sleeping by the wall there for a week. Skunk. It stinks horrible. Yeah. So they weren't as good? That's all I know. Yeah. So how, did you, what year did you become a citizen of? Huh? What year did you become a citizen? Well, about a year after I come here. Oh no, that takes five years. No. Didn't do that there. I was up there at the courthouse and there was a big guy there. And they had all kinds of examinations and stuff. So, I was citizen. And then I went to Seventh Street and took a room upstairs there. And I had my trunk wet and my money on papers and everything in that trunk. So I went up across the street to a hotel where they had dances and stuff. What the heck was that name? That burned up years ago from fire in the war. What was the name of that? Years ago there were a lot, they played pool and everything in there. That's a big hotel. And they had dinners. They had bowling alleys in the basement. Every day they had nice dinners and they have a tavern in there and everything. What the hell was the name of that street? I know the guy that stole my money and that stuff. I had him arrested. He was in for three days and three nights in the cell. And he went to Minneapolis and he's dead now. He took all my money I had in the bill for. And my paper and I was born and everything. Ain't that something? You never got it back? No. Never. How many presidents have you voted for now? Huh? How many presidents have you voted for? Remember the president? I don't know. Did you vote a Republican or Democrat? I voted Democrat all the time. All the time? Yeah. I don't vote no more, I quit. A year ago I started voting and they gave me a ticket and I went out to vote. I went back and threw the goddamn ticket in her face. I says when I vote there was something to vote on. And I walked out of there. I've never been there since. Over here a couple blocks. They have that new system you punch through the walls. In the church I think in the basement in the church. That's tapered church. Yeah. Won't I just stay where I am that's all. You have done your part now. Huh? You have done your part of life. Yeah. Just hang on there. You have no gun under your bed mattress or nothing? No. What would you do if someone walked in and he had a gun too? I don't want to shoot anything. No.
