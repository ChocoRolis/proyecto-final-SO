 depression. But you don't remember your parents if they had... your mother didn't work outside of home. She maybe went out and did housework. Sometimes to pitch in to help out. So there was not enough time for one member in the family to survive on. You had to be scratching. Yeah, right. And even the kids now, if you worked, you had to pitch in too to pay home. Sure. A few dollars whenever you could. So you were not able to save any bank accounts or anything like that? No, no. You didn't have any money in the bank? No. So you didn't lose any money in the bank either? No, I guess I can't say that either. No? No. So how did you meet your first husband? His name was Trigg. Jan Trigg. Jan Trigg. And he was from Sweden? From Bohuslän. Bohuslän. What part of Bohuslän? Do you remember the place? I've forgotten. But he was born there. Yeah. I can't remember just where he came from. I've forgotten. But he came here in 1920s then? He came in 1928. Twenty-eight? Uh-huh. So he was quite new then. Oh, yeah. How did you meet him? Oh, I went out to a park with some friends and I met him out there. He was with a relative of mine. So that's how you met him? Uh-huh. What kind of work did he do? He was a die sinker. Oh, I see. In the factories then. So did he, you met then in 1936, 30? 36, I believe. Oh, he had a job then? Part-time. He wasn't too good at that time either. So they were still pretty slackline then? Oh, yeah. But you married then, 30? We married in 37. 37. And who married you? Did you go out to Belvedere? No, we went to Chicago. Chicago? Yeah, I had an aunt in there, so we married in her house by Methodist minister. So you had them as your witnesses then. A lot of people from Rockford, they went outside to marry. Why was that? To keep a little bit secret, you think? I, no. Because a lot of them went to Belvedere. Well, maybe so. There were church members there, but they went to Belvedere. Yeah, well, I had this aunt in Chicago, so she wanted to have the wedding there, so. So you had the ceremony at her home then? Yeah. And then you went back to Rockford, did you go on a trip for like a honeymoon or? No. It was kind of unusual to take off at that time. Yeah. After you married, because it was. Bad times. Bad times, yeah. No money saved up for any recreation. So did you start to work then when you married, or did you stay home? I stayed home. Home? Mm-hmm. He worked part time. And you rented a home then? Yes. To start with. And you had a car at that time, you could, or did you use the. Yeah, I think we did. I think we did. Mm-hmm. Did you join any organizations as Swedish? No, never had. You was not a member either? No. Oh, never had. So you stayed outside. Did you ever start to talk Swedish to him then at that time, you remember that? Because his English was probably not that good. Oh, he had been here several years then. He talked English. When he came to the 8th? Yeah. So he was able then to converse? Oh, sure. Sure, he talked real good English. Were you able to talk Swedish to him then? Oh, yeah. I learned that when I was a young kid, you know. Been around Swedes all my life. Oh. So your parents, did they talk Swedish most of the time? Yes, I think so. They did? Mm-hmm. And when they had friends over at their house, they was usually in Swedish. Oh, yeah. The Swedish went better with the coffee. Yeah, right. So he continued then to be a dye sinker? Yeah, for many years. What did he work at? What factory? Rockford Forging Dye and Tool. I can't remember all the places now. I can't think of them now. He worked in California for a while too. Oh, he left Rockford? Did you leave too then? Oh, yeah. We went to Chicago. We went to Chicago. We lived there a few years. In the 30s? Oh, yeah. It was after 37, 38, 39, something like that. And you didn't join any groups in Chicago? No, no. Was that on the north side you stayed on or? South side. South side? Mm-hmm. And then you came back and you went to California? We went to California. Direct from Chicago? Oh, we moved around quite a bit. We went to Chicago and then we came back to Rockford and then we came to Love's Park. And then we went back to Chicago and to California. We were there five and a half years. He wasn't like me. I stuck to one place and her husband, he moved around a lot. And then he was going to go to Sweden, so I came back here and he was in Sweden for just a few weeks and we stayed here after that. We never went anywhere after that. But you went to California though? Yeah, we were there five and a half years. Five and a half years? Mm-hmm. And you had the children then during that time? I just had one. I see. So what kind of work did he get out there in California? Tysinking. Tysinking. For Alcoa. I see. So he was looking for a better position? Oh, yeah, sure. All the time to? Oh, yeah. Yeah, he had to have work. Did he have plans to go back to Sweden to stay you think? No. No? Only for a visit? He was there three times since he came here. Did you go with him? No. So your husband, he came from Bosland, you think it was Svenneby? Mm-hmm. He was born there, I know. Born in Svenneby. So he had his parents still in Sweden and the brothers and sisters he went to. Was he the only one of the family that came here? That's right. So after five and a half years in California, did you get set on that climate then to stay there forever or how did you like it? Where did you stay in California? Yeah, it was Hermosa Beach and you think I can remember that other one now? What is that close to, Los Angeles area? It's about 13 miles from Long Beach. Oh, Long Beach. Down by the ocean. Yes. Down by the ocean. It's beautiful there, though. Yeah, it was very nice. So how did you like it out there? Oh, I liked it while I was there, but I don't care to go back there. No? No, too much people and too much traffic and too big, too expensive everything now. So at that time it was very… It was nice. We had friends out there. Swedes? Yeah. So why did he come back then if you liked the area? Well, he was a type like that. He wanted changes all the time. He took his leg up. Yeah, and then he wanted to go to Sweden for a trip and so he went. But then you settled here in Labs Park. Did he work out here then, close to here, or why did you settle out here? Oh, that's a long ago. I don't remember what he did at that time. Did he work for Ingersoll? No. He must have worked in furniture factories at that time, I believe. So he commuted back and forth then into Rockford. You bought a house out there then? Yeah, we had a house here. So your kids then grew up here and went to school here in Labs Park? I just have the one daughter. Yeah, she went to school here. That's right. You have only one daughter here. Yeah. And then you stayed out here then? All your time? You didn't move away from Labs Park after that? Oh, yes. We went to Chicago. Oh, I don't know. I guess I got this all mixed up. I've got it all mixed up. But you stayed here the latest? We lived here in Labs Park and then we moved to Chicago for the second time. And we were in there for about five and a half years, I guess. So we did move around an awful lot. You needed a mobile home. Yeah, so when we came back, I said, I'm not going to move anymore. And I lived in Rockford then after we came back from California for 25 years and we never moved until I come here. So, and your husband died then? Oh, yeah. He died five years ago. I see. So you retired then as a dyeing, dye sinker you said. And then you met another tool and dye maker, Alvar Peterson. And he stayed with his bench all his life. That's right. You just didn't move. Why is it we are so different? I mean, she married a guy here now that wanted to move, move, move, move. Yeah. A little different people, I guess. They treated us very nice. But some, they like to move around to find great places. We're all different. And it's hard, I suppose, on the other half. Oh, yeah. Yeah. But now you are together and he won't move. That's what he said. No, he won't move until they carry him out, I guess. And you don't let him too either now because you have too many moves already. He does as he wants. So who is the boss now? I mean, how does it work out now when you come in here? This is the boss. He's been married three times. He's the boss. He's got a lot of experience. He's the boss. If it's my friend or not, I don't know. So you, you, you are the boss. Yeah. But she has the final say. She has the final say though. Oh, no. Oh, no. No, you got to get a little fired. So, what church did you join now or attend? Is he still the free church man? No, no. I always went to the Salvation Army. And so when we were going to get married, he decided we'd get married at the Salvation Army. So that's where we got married. In that little room where we had home lake? That's where we got married. So he belongs to Hemförbundet also? No. Well, he goes. So it's only for women? No. Anybody can go. Yeah, but you don't see any men there? Yeah, sometimes. Sometimes. But they don't know better, you know. No, he goes bowling that day, so I go there. I go there every Sunday. So then ever since we got married, we've been going to the Salvation Army every Sunday morning and went to their doings. Oh, you go there every Sunday morning? Oh, yeah, sure. Yeah? Sure. I see. Yep. So in your case now, is there any difference in religion between the mission covenant and the free church and the Salvation Army? No. Not that I can see. No? You are enjoying their services? Sure. They offer the same gospel in my opinion. So there you are. But the music is different though. A lot of music. They got a whole music in the Salvation Army, they hold them in the church. No. Do you know him and his parents, my brother-in-law's parents, they came from Jönköping, a whole mess of family. And they belong to the Salvation Army? Oh, yeah. Do you know Martin Palmer? No, the name only. Oh, I see. So you had the... See, my brother-in-law's Roland Nelson. My sister's Catherine Nelson. I see. They sing, they're in the string band. So you knew the Salvation Army way, way back then? Oh, way back when, yeah. Since I've been 16 years old. So you are also active then, like in Hemforbundet, you take part in it? Yeah, yeah, I go there all the time, every month. And it's all in Swedish? Oh, yeah. And you have no trouble to understand what they're talking about? The method. Because they are thinning out there too, the old members. Yeah, mostly American. Really Swedish. Right. The background, they are falling by the side. So your lesson, Alvar Pedersen, is en dag, ett ögonblick i sänder. Ja. Before you elect a new president. The next election, you are going to be very careful. Why? Well, I mean, you can trust them. You see, you voted for Nixon, you voted for Reagan. Yeah, I did. It was my fault. I know, but how do you feel then? I mean, it's not your fault really, because you believe the guy. Don't you get a certain mistrust then? I don't know what to say about that. So in your opinion anyway, one that you really believe in and still believe in, there was Roosevelt. Yeah, that's for sure. I believe in him. He didn't backtrack you in any way. I mean, you could still believe him after he died. I sure did. And I thought Truman was a good man. He was rough in his speech and so on, but I think he had good ideas. So historically, they are going to be good presidents. Yeah. But some of the rest... To hell with them. That's what his thing was. You had to borrow Truman's phrases, you know. To hell with them. So Roosevelt... We all have our faults. There's nothing to be ashamed of. So... Yeah, it's not easy I suppose. But what he is mixing up with foreign countries, I don't know. I can't see it. Holger Daniel Alvarna Tanelli. Signe Pettersson. Park, Illinois. Stute på interview.
