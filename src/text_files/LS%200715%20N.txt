 Printerson. That was the one that went to Alaska to dig gold, and he came back and bought the factory up there in Svanaholm. Oh, no, no. That's the guy I think. You never heard of that? My uncle. His name was Helmer. But he went to Alaska and tried to get some gold. Helmer Printerson? Yeah, but he didn't have nothing. He came home and he bought the farm. I see. In Ektermark? In Oshbyn. Oshbyn. And that was your mother's brother? That was my—pardon? That was your mother's brother? Yeah. Yes, that's right. I'm sitting together with Herman Johansson in Rockford, Illinois. He was born July 12, 1909, in Ektermark, Sweden, and came to the United States in 1928. Your parents now, your father, was he a farmer up there in— Well, we had a little farm, you know, where we could barely feed two cows and maybe half a dozen chickens. Mostly we worked around the timber. There's a lot of timber up in that area. And then in the summertime, we used to go work for a fellow by the name of—I don't know if I can remember his name. How many kids were you in the family, brothers and sisters? We were eight, I was with dad and mom. How many boys? Only one more. Two boys? No. You and Harry, two boys. Two boys, and then he died, and you are the only— No, no, no. No, no one died except—my sister died. Oh, I see. Two of my sisters. So you were two boys, then, and six girls? Yeah. No, he's talking about his parents, too, aren't you? How many kids? How many kids? How many children in your family? I have two. I have two. I have two. I have two. I have two. I have two. I have two. I have two. I have two. I have two. How many children in your family in Sweden did your mother and father have? They had eight children. Six, I believe. You had one, two—you had four girls and two boys. Well, this was—people in Lebanon, they had one, two. Well, how many were they? I mean— We were eight kids. Eight kids? Yeah. Two boys and six girls? No, you didn't have that many. No, it was two— You had six kids? Four. Four. Four. Four girls and two boys. Well, there were six then. Myself and my brother Harry. So there were six then? Yeah. Six of you, huh? Don't count your mother and father, see? He was counting. Oh, I see. I asked the family there. So you had an uncle, then they went to Alaska. Yeah. Do you remember talking to him? Did he come back, then— Oh, yeah. He bought oarsprings? Oh, yeah. We talked, yeah. What did he say? He said, you know, he said, you know, he said, you know, he said, you know, he said, you know, he said, you know, he said, you know, he said, you know, he said, you know, he said, you know, you said, you know, he said, you know, he said, you know, you said. Oh, yeah. some place in Alaska, but he didn't have no money I guess, so he walked. He shot rabbits and cooked them on a stick, you know. That's the only thing he could have to eat. How long did he stay there? I don't know. I think it was, if I don't remember wrong, it was around ten years. Oh, ten years? He was in Alaska. He didn't get too much gold. I think he spent almost all the money he made anyway. So that was in the early, no, late 1800s then? No, that was... 1880s? That was... I say it was in the 20s. 1920s, something like that. Oh, that late? He came back? He came back. So then he bought the fox's farm. That was in Oospin. Oh, there was your mother? She was born there? Yeah, he was born there. Oh. And that's in Ettemark too, though? Yeah, that's in Ettemark. In Ettemark, yeah. So he settled on and then married in Oospin? Did he marry? No, he wasn't married. He never married? No. So they was the only one in the family that was in America or outside Sweden. How about your father? Who? Your father. He was in this country for about 13 years. In the United States? He was out in Seattle, Washington, where he was working as a lumberjack. Oh, I see. That was before he was married? Yeah. So he came back in the late 1890s then and married your mother? Just about that time. What did he say about the United States? Well, the only thing I can remember he said that they were rough people, the ones that worked in the lumberyard or lumber camps. He said if one person got hurt or killed or something like that, they didn't pay any attention to it. There were others waiting to come in? He was a soft filer for the gang. That's all he did? That's all he did then. He was 10. I think he said he got about $35 a month. And then the boarding room? Boarding room, yeah. So he was there for 13 years? He was there for 13 years. And there was the big timber out there? Oh, yeah, there was a lot of big timber out there. So there was a lot of sawtooth to keep sharp? Oh, yeah. Big saws? Uh-huh. So when you were growing up, did you... Well, when we first came, me and another neighbor that came at the same time I did. But he stopped in Chicago, and I had some friends from the northern part of Atomac. And there was around Fourth of July, so they drove the car from Rockford to Chicago, where some of the relatives lived. And they stayed a couple of days because they shut down the factory. Fourth of July? That was during the time when Rockford was known as the furniture factory town. And... How did you get the idea to go to the United States now? Did you... your parents? My neighbor, Robert Gustafson, he was from Banks Forge. He just died there about three or four weeks ago. Here in Rockford? No, in Banks Forge. Oh, in Banks Forge. And so he says, Why don't you come over to the United States? But then the only thing I could come into this country was by going as farm help. And he stayed in Chicago then, but he was a pretty nice furniture worker. And he started working in the factory where they made big tables for big offices and stuff like that. Did he have experience from Sweden, or how did he get into that kind of job? Well, I didn't work... No, but I mean Robert Gustafson. Did he have experience from furniture? Yeah, his father made casket, leekshift. Leekshift, yeah. So he got his training there then? Yeah, so that's what he worked with instead. So he left for the first time in 1928 then? Yeah. And then how many others? Were you more than two of you? It was only me and him. So he asked you to go with him? Yeah. So then I went to... I can remember where we lived. He came and he asked... I can't quite get this. I got this Parkinson's disease, so I can't quite... It's hard to remember, yeah. Hard to remember. What kind of work were you doing then? You helped your dad on the farm? Yeah, me and my dad, we were always out in the woods. In the wintertime, we would cut down the trees. And in the summertime, we would float the timber from a certain place out in the bay. And the steamboats would come and pick up the lumber. Mostly it was... Pulp? Massavel. Massavel. And so, I guess some were made for boards too. So they went to Billingsfors and Hoverström and... Gustafsfors. Gustafsfors. And Billingsfors and Skopafors. All those places. I was on Dalslands Kanal then, at the same time. So you've been on Dalslands Kanal many times then? No, just three times. Three times? But I mean, you were home then as a young boy? Oh, no, I stayed home. You stayed home, yeah. So you worked with your father then? There was no other brother? Well, we worked together. We worked for a fellow by the name of Carl Larsson. He was kind of a... He had boards up the timbers. And then he, I guess, evidently sold it to these different companies. He was a buyer then? He was a sort of buyer, yeah. So what did your dad say when you came up to him and he said that... Well, he said, you wouldn't starve if you go to the United States. He said, but you have to be kind of careful so that somebody can get a hold of you. They might think you are some bull boy. So he gave you some word of warning then to protect yourself? So when I came to that country, then I worked in... So how did you get... Did you buy the ticket or did somebody send...? Oh yeah, we bought the tickets. In Bengtsfors? Well, I guess, I think we bought the tickets when we came to Gothenburg. You have to take... Examination? Doctorate examination. What did the pastor say when you came there to...? Oh, Pastor Booman. He had... Pete Schaig? Pete Schaig was gone. And he says, What's got to do in America, under three million, you are a business man. What's got to do there, he said. Well, he knew that already, 1928? Well, he didn't. He read that in the papers. So he didn't want anybody to leave the Socken or wherever we lived. He wanted you to stay home? Yeah. And there was your confirmation, Pastor? That was where we went for confirmation. Was there anybody else that had left for America before you left? There was a lot of them, a lot. So you know quite a bit then? Yeah, but at that time I can't remember. Yeah, this Robert Gustafson had a brother by the name of Eric. Because he's dead now, too. Was he in Chicago? He went to Chicago. So he was there before him then? Yeah, he was a little bit before. So he came to him then? Pardon? He came to him then? Yeah, I guess they stuck together. And they rented an apartment in a couple of places I know. But I forgot most of it. But they lived together. I had an old Cleveland, and I used to go in and visit them sometimes. So when you went over now, did you have any problems on the boat or Ellis Island? No, no. You didn't go to Ellis Island? No, no. We never stopped there. We went directly into the harbor. But none of you could speak English, though. How did you get the thing? I couldn't even remember the yes and no. The only thing, I smoked at that time. And we were kind of questioning around what was a good cigarette. So Robert, he said that he too smoked. He says, Camel, that was the only thing I used to smoke. They had Camel? So we smoked Camel. So did you stay in Chicago with Robert? No, we only stayed there a couple of weeks because there was no... You know, I was a small boat... You were clean out of there? Pardon? You were clean to be out of there? Yeah. Well, there were only two of us with Robert. Eric and the other guys didn't work for somebody else. I forgot who Eric worked for. So you went to Rockford right away? Yeah. Then they came to Chicago. They had a Chrysler Roadster. Are you running on the film? No, no. They had a Roadster Chrysler. So I rode with them back home Sunday night. To Rockford? To Rockford, yes. And they were people from Ettermark. Did you know them? Well, there were only two and I was the only one. And I sat in the... He had a rumble seat. So I sat in the rumble seat to Rockford. So you felt pretty good then? Oh, yeah. This was the land? Did you know these people before... Oh, yeah. Before you came over? They were neighbors. So they had good furniture work here in Rockford? Yeah. They worked for Landströms Republic? Yeah, Landströms. Landströms Furniture Shop. I guess all along came to Rockford and they worked for Landströms. Oh, so it was... Många dagslänningar, det. Oh, yeah. So when you came with them, did you stay with them for a while then or did you rent your own room? Yeah, we stayed in a place on 10th Avenue and 7th Street. They had a flat there. They rented... There were four of them. Yeah, four of them. So I could stay there. So the next morning they went to work and I stayed home. They told them, don't go too far, or my kid's lost on 7th Street. So I got kind of hungry in the middle of the day. But then I knew that there was a lot of Swedes, you know, they had their own restaurant up on 7th Street. So I didn't have too much money, but I guess I had enough for coffee and a couple of rolls. So they kept me till they come from work. So they said, tomorrow you can go to work. So I worked 10 hours the first day. Was this at Landstrom's? At Landstrom's. And I remember they had a clock right on the wall where I was working. So every couple of minutes I looked at the clock. But I worked 10 hours. That was a long day. It was a long day. I thought it would never come to an end. What kind of work was it? Was it easy? Sand. Sanding. Mostly. The boss told me to sand radio legs. Just take the corners off. With sandpaper? With sandpaper. So how did you feel on the first day? I mean, 10 hours workday with the clock hanging over your head. Pretty tired, I guess. I remember the boss came and said, You can't put the radio legs on the floor. They should be on a clock. So I said, I don't know if that's what you're talking about. So they could speak Swedish? Oh yeah, they talk Swedish. They are all Swedish. Even the Italians talk Swedish. They did? Oh sure. And there was quite a few Norwegians there too. So there was all Scandinavian and Italians. The Italians now, what kind of work were they doing? They were sanding. Sanding. There was no Italian foreman? No, I don't think so. They were all Swedish? They were all Swedish. So you met Bernard Magnussen there in the North Sea? No, that I don't remember. You don't remember those names? So how was it? Was it a hard job? No. It wasn't hard. They were sanding sharp corners off. So they were a little round. But you had to do it fast? I mean to do many a day? Yeah. Because they didn't go after us too much. They were standing above you all the time. So you could take a little rest. But there was no coffee break in the morning? Oh no, no coffee break. There was breakfast and lunch? Breakfast and lunch. I don't think even breakfast you ate at home. But you had lunch with you? Yeah, lunch with us. We paid $5 for a meal ticket. And that lasted you one week. One week. So they prepared a lunch for you at the restaurant then? At the restaurant, yes. So you had to eat sharp when you had breakfast? Yeah. How did they keep though? I mean in the hot summer? The food, the sandwiches and cold cuts on there? I can't remember that far. You got used to that too? Because there was no refrigeration at that time? No. Where you could put the sandwiches with cold cuts on? No, we usually got some kind of a... Sausage? Well I don't know if it was sausage, it was usually maybe a cheese sandwich. So it didn't spoil then in the heat? Yeah, but we never thought of that. We were hungry. Because you won them many times so they could keep, you know... Wax paper probably stuck in. We had some kind of a spread, sandwich spread. I remember I didn't like it too well. Well there's probably something you've got to be careful about over in South. They start to get green, you know, at the edges. Yeah. But at that time you didn't have any wrapping paper, there was newspapers, wasn't there? I don't know. Do you remember that? Yeah, I think we... You had newspapers around it? Yeah, but I think we always had a bag. A brown bag? Brown bag. But I think we had... There was no wax paper at the time? I can't remember. You had that? Well there could be. I can always remember wax paper. I guess they weren't worried about us. They were strong? There was enough of them. They were all hungry? Yes. So how long did you stay then at Landstrom's? Well I stayed there till... I came from Chicago to Rockford, like I said. 28? 28. So I stayed in Chicago only about a week, two weeks. In Chicago? In Chicago. But then after you started at Landstrom's, how long did you stay on there? Until the Depression? Well I started to work right away and I stayed there. I worked there for about five years. Five years? At Landstrom's. So you had a lot of friends then from Ettemark there? Yeah, there was usually mostly from Darsland. So five years, that means that you went into 1933? 1933. You had steady work? Yeah, there was the Depression then, so most of us worked only three to four days a week. And you were still doing the sanding job? Yeah. All the time? No, I put a lot of the... We were making bedroom suits, like vanity and dressers and night tables. I put the tops on and glued them, put blocks on. Oh, you mean the veneer? You put the veneer on and clamped it together? We clamped it together, yeah. But it was a hard job, though, they say. Well, you had to lift it on top of each other with no drawers in them. Oh, I see, so they were not too bad to handle then. So what happened in 1933 when you started to get slack? Then we got fired because there was no work at all. In those days, we didn't have no seniority. No pension, nothing. No pension, nothing. And no union. No union. They didn't like unions on their land terms. Nobody liked unions, I suppose. No, no, no. That was a bad word. But nobody talked about unions, though, at that time. No, they didn't think about the union. They were so too new. I guess the only ones that had the union was the laborers. And the carpenters and the bricklayers. Carpenters, yeah. But it was strange, though, that the factory workers couldn't get together. Yeah. But then the Depression hit. The Depression came when I was around 30. Did they close up a lot of shops, though? Yeah, there were a lot of furniture shops. Scandia, Empire. You went from one shop to another when you got laid off, I suppose. So you tried them all then, Empire, Republic? Republic, I worked there for a while. Rockford, I ask? I don't know. Bookcase. Bookcase. Winnebago Furniture? Huh? Winnebago? Winnebago, I worked there, too. Winnebago was a furniture factory. So there were furniture factories almost in every other corner in Rockford at that time. Oh, yeah. All over the place. They were the highest, the biggest, most people working for the list factory was Lannister. But then he died in the 1930s, didn't he? No, I think he lived on until 1935. 1935? Lannister. And his son took it over? Huh? And his son took it over then? No. Well, didn't he say no? No, no. Then I don't know much about it because we— You never worked there anymore after that? I went out and worked at different factories. Furniture factories. Finally, I decided to try to get in the— Metal? Yeah. So when I was— Me and my wife, we started to work to go together. And then 1940, we got married. And then I got a job in a— LQ or— Rockford Clutch. Or Rockford Clutch. Rockford Clutch. So there was a complete different line of work? Yeah. How did you like that? I mean, the transfer— Oh, that was all right. Was that better than furniture? That was not a— We had— Most of it was piece work, piece work at that time. It was for the war industry then, passing on. So you met your wife then at work, or how did you meet? You met— I met her— Blind date. Blind date. Blind date. Yeah. So you joined the church then when you came from Dahlstrand? You joined the church here and organizations of various kinds? Well, we didn't belong much to a church until about 1942, 43. Oh, I see what you— So we got kids, you know. How about organizations? Did you join the Varsas with your Vikings? Oh, we didn't do that until 1950. Oh, I see. In 1952, 1953, I think, we joined Varsas. So you didn't join anything in the beginning then? No. We used to go up to Viking. We used to go around to the Swedish lodges, you know. Oh, for dances and— There was Viking and there was Baltic and there was all kinds of lodges. Yeah. We thought there was too much money to join. It cost us about 75 cents a month to be a member. And it was hard to get a job. But then, of course, when we got married and got kids, then we started to join Lutheran church. You joined the Norwegian Lutheran church then? So you were born here in Raks? Well, she did, but I didn't. That's a shame. Oh. I don't know. That was 1953. How about this blind date now? How come you met a Norwegian girl on a blind date? Well, she was working at a lock company. Oh, National Lock? Yeah. And then she worked—most of the time she worked nights. Three shifts he was working in. But there was a girl that she went with a fellow that was a Swedish guy, and he had a friend, Herman. Sight two, continuation with Herman Johansson, Rockford, Illinois. Sight two. So when you married then in 1941 or 44? 1940. 1940, 1940. Did you stop working then, or did you continue on for a while? I was still a while, yeah. At National Lock. You worked only a couple of years, in a way? Yeah, maybe it was a year, year and a half. There were a lot of women working then in the industry all over the place. But there wasn't as much as then. More time, I guess. There's more now. More now. There's more and more than before. Yeah, during the war. Peace was to come. How did you—when you started to live together, did you rent an apartment or did you buy a house? Apartment. You rented an apartment first? No. Well, no. Yeah, well, I guess we didn't. How about your friends now, Herman? How did they make it through the Depression? Did they marry or did they move back to Sweden again, or what happened? Well, of course, by working at Lansdome, we knew all those fellows. The one who came to Sweden with Sir Alfred Bliss, he moved back. Robert Gustafson, he moved back? Who? Robert Gustafson. Oh, yeah. He moved back. Well, no, he still was in Chicago. Oh, he was? Yeah, but he went back to Sweden to live. When did he go back to Ettenmark? 1947, the first time. 47. So he stayed over the Depression then? No, he's talking about when he went back. I was just there for— Oh, I see. But how about this Robert Gustafson? When did he go back? Oh, he went back about 1934, I think. He didn't stay too long. And he was not married then? Yeah, he was married. I think he was married. So she went with him? No, maybe not. No, I don't think so. I can't remember her name, maybe. So he went back and never returned? Mm-mm. Never returned? No, he stayed home. How about you now? Did you have any thoughts of going back? I mean, if there was problems during the Depression? No, I didn't think about it because I know my dad had to borrow money to make me come to this country. Oh, to get a ticket? Yeah. So I was not thinking about being able to go back to Sweden or anything. So I figured I had to stay. Did you write to your dad many times during the Depression? Did you tell him there were hardships here, or did you explain to him? It was hard to explain, I suppose, because it's... I always wrote letters that Dad wrote. I usually write them. So did he ask you about things? Yeah, I suppose I did. He did. He was not interested to come over for a visit to Sweden? Oh, he wanted to come back. He wanted to come back? My dad, yeah. So he's still in this body? What did you say then? Well, I mean my dad. Yeah? Did you tell him to wait a while? No, I never talked about it. It wouldn't have been easy if he had come here during the Depression. No, there wasn't. There was not the right time? No, there wasn't. But he stayed in Ertemark? Yeah, he stayed in Ertemark. How about the farm? Did they go to one of your sisters or to your brother? No, they auctioned it off. Oh, I see. Somebody bought them. They left the family then? Yeah, but it was a nice place. We had a little Rødstuga. Rødstuga, yeah. By Lake Lelungen. Your dad, no, he never wrote back to you over here, I mean, and told you about it, you were going to come home and buy it or to take over it? Yeah, well, I don't think he was afraid of that. He didn't encourage you, I mean, to go back and take over the farm? No, there wasn't enough. You would have to work up inside there anyway. And that was too hard of a life, I suppose, to be in the woods in the wintertime. You didn't like that too much then? I don't know. I never paid much attention. Yeah, but if you compare now the work you had to do home on the farm in the wintertime, out in the woods, with working at Landstrom's and Rockford Clutch, which was the easier life, you think? Well, I don't know. You didn't know anything in Sweden, of course, that was all you knew. I didn't know, I was just a dumbo. You had no comparison. But what do you think about it? Little by little, you know, we started to learn. There was more freedom, though, when you were home on the farm. Yeah, but we were always, we had to work almost all the time. And usually it was... Yeah, but you didn't have that darn clock facing you, though, in the... No, no, of course not....during the daytime. In the wintertime, then, we had to go by daylight. Short days, you know, so when it was about close to 4 o'clock or something like that, then you had to put the axe away because it would start to get too dark. But then you had a lot of spare time, though, in the... Pardon? Then you had a lot of spare time, though, in the evenings. Yeah, I would read the paper, I would sit and talk, because there were several other, like, log cabins where the guys did it. And they were mostly from Dalsland or Bengtsvost. And so they were just like a... Oh, so you didn't go home at night, then, when you were out in the woods? No, we stayed in the cabins. You stayed out in the woods? Cabins, and we cooked our own food. It was just like the United States, then, in America. Yeah. So he sharpened the saws, your dad? Pardon? He was good at sharpening the saws? Yeah. It was his line of work. Did you learn to do that, too, to sharpen the saws? Oh, no, I just helped him cut the trees down. And saw them up. So then you went back to Sweden in 1947? Yeah, well, I was just home for a little stay. Your dad and mother were still living, then? Oh, yeah. Still living. So was he glad, then, to have you back? I think my... I don't think so. I think your dad passed away. My dad just died all the night. So you never met him, then, though? You were never able, then, to meet with him and discuss America to him? I mean, between you and him? Yeah. So he was gone, then. And the farm, was it sold? Was the farm sold already, then, in 1947? I don't remember. His mother was still living. Still living there? Yeah. Did you go with your husband? No, I didn't, but we went back in 1970. Oh, I see. But she was gone, then. And then you had the kids with you, or...? No, they were growing up, then. They were all growing up, yeah. So you being a Norwegian background, did you also go to Norway, then, to find out about your parents? I met some of my aunts and uncles. They come from the southern part of Norway? No, they're from Horten. Oh, Horten. It's not too far away. No, it's not too far away. So you decided not to stay in Sweden, then, when you went back in 1947? No. In 1907, either? I just wanted to go home, because my mother was still living. My daddy died. He died earlier? Yeah. I don't know just what year it was. I got it written down. I think it was just a couple years before. So did you send home coffee, then, during the war? Oh, yeah. They had some coffee? Often, but I didn't have too much money either, so once in a while, we sent home coffee. Yeah. They were shorties already, 11, still, 1947. Oh, really? Yeah. You probably had coffee with you, then, at that time. Yeah, I guess maybe I did. So there was a new, different life for you. Yeah, I'd say there was. You stayed in Rockford and lived in Rockford all your life? I've been in Rockford ever since. Ever since you are. Did you continue to work for Rockford Clutch? Well, no, I stayed there, yes, I stayed there 19 years. 19 years? No, I don't know. 29. 29. 29 years. 29. I see, so you retired from there, then? I retired from there. Yeah, I'm glad I did, too. Oh, I suppose it was a long work day. Well, they had a union there, and they had good, you know, housing. So they had union, you were with them, then, when they started the union? Oh, yeah. How did they work? We had a red cap on us that says UAW. A red cap? Yeah. How did you do? We were both kind of looking around the corner. How did you dare do that? I mean, they couldn't do anything about it, though. We had to sign up so we could have elections. So we had an election, and we won. They got the first contract. We didn't make much at that time. So you worked under the union rules, then, for most of your time? I worked. Excuse me. So that was after the war, then, the union started? Yeah. So that was a good thing? Yeah. If you compare it to a few years earlier. Yeah, more and more of them, then. And it was a good union. You got pensions, and you got hospitalization. Yeah, hospitalization. Vacation. Vacation. Holidays. Because the first contract we had, we didn't get much. It was the beginning, though, I mean. The beginning. You couldn't ask for too much. Yeah. Because then it might have closed down the plant. Yeah. So then you joined the Vasa Order in 1950, you said? 1950. Bra i large, Elvira? Elvira. Did you join also Norwegian organizations like Harmony? No, I didn't. No? No, I didn't. No? Only the Swedish. Mm-hmm. Yeah. So you had worked pretty good, then. Your dad said that you got to be careful. I'm still here. And work hard. Yes, work, piece work. Oh. But how did that affect you, now, the piece work? You were stronger. You were younger. You could work harder and faster. Or you started to get a little bit older. Didn't that hamper you a little bit? I mean, were you able then to keep up with it? No, no. No? You had more and more experience, then, to make it easy for you. Mm-hmm. Different parts you got to work on. And if you run out of that, then you got another different machine or whatever. I mean, you got up in the 50s, now, and close to 60. Did you have another job, then, a little bit more easy for you? No, I worked in a tool room. In a tool room? Because it's, I suppose, it would be hard when you get up in the 60s to keep up like a 20-year-old. Mm-hmm. So you were able, then, to transfer to an easier job. Well, it wasn't easy. It was not easier, but there was— Because you didn't have to have any piece work when you worked. You didn't have the whip over your back to do it fast. Yeah. So your children, are they staying in Rockford? Well, they live in Chicago now. Chicago. All of them? Mm-hmm. Oh, no, one's in Iowa. He just moved. Mm-hmm. So they went through high school, then, and college, too? Yeah. Yeah. So they left Rockford. Yeah, they threw all those boys, they were in the service. So they got to go to Cherville. Yeah. They got their college education. Oh, I see. Yeah. So then they got opportunities outside the city. Mm-hmm. Oh. Had they married, Swedish-Norwegian background? No, they didn't. Good. They just married all-American girls. All-Americans? You know, mixed-geared. Oh. Yeah. They didn't belong to us or any organization? Yeah, two of them joined. Oh, really? But they don't ever attend because they're not in Rockford. They joined the Rockford Life. Oh. Just to please us, I guess. Oh, oh. They're looking for new members all the time. So you had pretty good contact then with Sweden over the years. You had your sisters still there? Oh, yeah. And they are still living? My youngest sister now, my youngest, youngest sister, she died several years. So you are the only one left then? No. No, I got three. He's the only one over here. But there are more sisters over in Sweden, huh? Yeah, he's got two sisters left. Two sisters in Sweden. I'm the oldest one in the family. Mm-hmm. So my sister Anna and my sister Gertrud and my brother Harry, they're still living. Oh. And they live in Banks Forest. They haven't been over here visiting you or? Mm-hmm. They stay put to Dalsland? Yeah. So you started for Rockford Clutch, and that was bought out by Borger Warner. Yeah. How did they affect your working conditions then? Was it better then when you came into? It was pretty much the same. About the same? Yeah. You didn't get any better situations? Well, no. We thought we had it pretty good then. Because it was a big outfit, Borger Warner. Yeah. But then there was Rockford Drill. First it was Rockford Drilling before they got into Borger Warner. Mm-hmm. You were at Rockford Clutch? Yeah. I'm in Rockford Clutch. Mm-hmm. And they are still here in Rockford? Oh, yeah. But they're in the Love's Park. In Love's Park. So they move out of the city? You've got a big plant there. Mm-hmm. See, the mechanics and Rockford Clutch went together, so they are one plant now. Otherwise, there was two before. Mm-hmm. When you came here in the 1920s, was it usual then that every home had a radio? Oh, no. It was unusual? Very, very. Maybe there were 10, one or less than that. Were you staying in the boarding house or you had an apartment? You didn't have a radio? No. So very few had the opportunity to listen to Roosevelt when he was having his fire-shed speeches. How did you know about that? Oh, there was an expert recording. I suppose we bought the… Yeah, but it gave me 1933, though. Yeah, I suppose. Do you remember listening to Roosevelt in the 30s? No, not on radio. Not on radio? No, we bought the newspaper. You never listened to his fire-shed speeches? No, we didn't have no radio, nothing. So there were few homes that had, in the 30s, radio? I think around 1940, everybody had. Then it came in more and more? Mm-hmm. Then we heard Roosevelt. Oh. Well, in 1936, I suppose a lot of people didn't have radio. They probably got a chance to buy one. So where did you buy your radio? Were you married? Yeah, I guess we got one when we were married. We had one before, but our folks had one, a small radio, table radio. But you don't remember the one that the crystal set that they listened to? Yeah, my brother, he made one, I remember, out of a crystal set. So for the people that came here, they probably didn't get accustomed to it until in the 40s, then, when they knew the language better. Because the first few years, it was probably hard to listen to the radio. Mm-hmm. Or understand what they said. Yeah, probably. So what year did you become a citizen? In the late 30s? I think. I think it was before we were married, so it must have been about 39. I think before we got married, you were— I think it was 19— What's the 1936? There were a lot of people becoming citizens then. Yeah. I got the paper, but now I couldn't— It's hard to remember the exact year, but it was in the— I'd say 1936 would be pretty close. Mm-hmm. Then you were able to vote for the president of your choice? Yeah. Oh.
