And when I first came here, he worked in a shop. It was Royal Mantle. And I got a job there too, so we worked together. Was that furniture? Yeah, I made furniture. And then, I don't know, I don't think it was more than one year we worked together, then he left for Chicago. Very carpenter job, yeah. So you were alone then in Rockford? Yeah. I've been in Chicago and San a couple times. So when you came over there, you had to go through Ellis Island? Yeah. Did you have any problems? No, not a problem. I got so cold and the boat was sick, so I walked on a pier, I guess. They took me into it. They stood there in order. If you don't look too good, you know, they say go through doctors. But I was all right. And that was on Oscar II? What? Oscar II was the ship? Yeah. The ship you came on? Yeah, it was an old ship. So when you came out of Rockford, where did you stay then? In a boarding house, or with the family, or with your brother? No, I rented a place. Your own place? No, my own room. My own room. Your room, yeah. And then we ate in a restaurant.

Sure. That was during the Depression. So you had plenty of work then during the 20s, after the Depression? You had plenty to do then during the 20s? You got to work in the factory and work your way up? In the 20s, yeah. But then the Depression started in 29, I guess. Yes. There's closed banks and factories. Factories were all closed. Did you have money? Then I got a job in a store fixer's shop after the Depression. So I was making all kinds of store fixers. And I think I worked there for over 30 years. 30 years? Until I retired. Down in Rockford? Yeah. Davis Store Fixer was the name. They don't exist anymore, but he died too. Did you join any church when you came here? No. No church? No. How about the Switzerland Church?

No. Saying that you needed more work? No. They never had that? No. No, there was more... Entertainment? There was not strong enough for that. Why didn't they become strong, though? I mean, here you had hard-line workers without jobs? I don't know. He was kind of a quiet guy. Tor Andersson, he was a quiet guy. Yeah. He didn't go out in the sun on the streets. And then I belonged to the union. And I was in the... I belonged to the carpenters' union. Oh, carpenters? Yeah. So you were a carpenters' union? Union, yeah. Well, in the shop, we don't get the carpenter's scale. But when we were out in Staling, then they'd be our scale. Carpenter's scale. There was another Ölanding here that belonged to Arbita Klubben, Einar Karlsson, from Persnes. Einar. Well, I know Einar Karlsson, but I don't know if he belonged there. I don't think so. He was here quite early. He came in 1917 or something like that. Yeah. I know Einar. He was married to Maja Karlsson. Yeah. How about Ölanding? She, you mean? No, Einar. Einar, yeah. I don't know.

I think he died in Chicago, yeah. He divorced on that time. Yes, yes. I got some special report. So, did you have any trouble then during the Depression to get a job? Were you out of a job for a while? Couldn't get a job. You know what I said? I didn't make a nickel for three years. Or often. Couldn't get a job. I walked around and they used to laugh at you when I come in and ask for work. How did you survive then? Well, I spent the money I had. Then I got a little relief. I think they got $1.75 a week. From the government? We had to live off. I don't know if it was from the city or government. I think they got it from the city. I don't think they got it from the federal government. You were never on WPA, huh? Huh? Did you get on WPA? Yeah, I'll be... WPA or CCC camp, you were not in those? No. No? There was only married people that could get on them. No, you couldn't get on WPA. You got $0.50 an hour then. For a single man? Yeah. No, I didn't get no job. So you walked the streets there for three years? Yeah. And then finally, I got a job in a restaurant. I was in business, so I got my fee there. That time, there didn't pay any. I tell you, there was an awful time here. You didn't think about going back to Ireland at that time? No. No? Well, if I'd known they were going to... I hadn't been there very long, see. So if I'd known they were going to be the person that long, then I'd take a trip, but I thought this would be suited over, so I could make a little more money, and then I could go home. But then year after year after year? Yeah. You were still hoping for a better day? Yeah. It was tough. Then, not the workers' club, but they had demonstrations, don don. They had? People, yeah. But nobody paid attention to it? No. It was just on deaf ears? Oh, sometimes there were fights or two. There was? Oh, yeah. A long time. Well, I suppose people were desperate. And they were hungry. And you were not married then, at that time? No. I ain't married, no. I lived with a friend. Oh, I see. So you were a single man? I am. Oh, it was 15 years ago, more or less. I got trouble with my heart. So I was in the hospital for quite a while. And then I still took all kinds of medicine, but I still had trouble with it. Yeah. So I suppose you got a job at Davis Hospital? So then I lived in a hotel. And then the doctor said I had to walk in the stair there. He said I couldn't walk in the stair. So I know that her folks there, we used to go out riding. I took them out for a long ride out in Arizona. Then I got up two or three times. So then when I couldn't walk in the stair, then they said I could walk in the stair here. So then I've been here. So it has been a long time in Rockford. And you've never been back to Sweden? No. I've been traveling quite a bit here in this country, but I've never been back. And your brother Walfred, he went back to Sweden? Who? Your brother. Yeah, my oldest brother, yeah. And then I had my youngest brother. He come here first to Rockford. It was just before the Depression. And then he got a job first. And then they laid him off. And he walked there like me and I had to... He was just new, so he had no money. I had to help him. And then there was a guy, he come over here with me, same company. And he was going to go back to Sweden. So then my brother said I'm going to go back with him. So they went on. And he was an old car, old Chevy, my friend, not my brother, you know. So they drove down to New York. And then my brother, I don't know, he happened to get acquainted with a guy that was going home to Sweden. So then he took me down to the shop where he worked. And he said you can get a job there. So he got the guy's job. So he stayed there. He didn't go home. So he married another family. And then he got cancer. And he died down there. He was only 49 years old when he died. So I went down there and saw him first, and then I went down there for the funeral. So over the years now, have you had any contacts with Sweden? Oh yeah, I write letters. Brothers and sisters. I still write to my sister. And they want you to come back, I suppose. Oh, they did before, but now I don't know. I'm 56. So there were some tough times then in the 30s. Oh yeah, oh gosh, yes. Rough, yeah. And then after that, you know, if I got money so I could go, I was free to. They do it to spend money. I took out some 30 gold silver. I had some money. But I didn't have help. You never played soccer like Algar here? No. Oh, you mean soccer ball? You haven't played when I first came here. You didn't? No. I had a team here in Rockford. 1923? 23. Did you play soccer ball? Yeah, I played with Baltic. Oh, oh yeah. Yeah, I didn't play for many years, about 20 years anyway. Chicago league. When I first came here, they were all on the Swedish American, I guess. They had the soccer ball team. And then the Irish had one. They were the only one here in town. And they were a pretty good team, both of them. And then they started to have a fight. And they had a fight one time, I don't know, took half of them to the hospital. And then they forbid you couldn't play anymore. They stopped the whole thing? They stopped the thing. Because they had a fight. For a while. For a while, but then I don't know, years after they started again. And they went to New York and they beat the Wrigleyers. And New York was the best team in the world. And they beat them one to nothing. Good team, actually, the Swedish American. Yeah, Karlsson, oh man. Uh-huh. Pindon. Well, I don't know what it was. Always the old people used to say, when I came here, the Swedes or the Irish was always fighting. They walked down to the bridge. The Irish were on the west side and the Swedes were on the east side. And then they always had a fight down there. So that was the daily medicine, huh? Yeah. And then I suppose when they had dances. They wanted to take each other girls and... Well, I don't know where it came from. Where they started off. It didn't take much. But the police department at that time, they were Swedish, though. The police chief and... Yeah. That time. Oh.
