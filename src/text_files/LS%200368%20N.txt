 Here is June 15, 1986, and I'm sitting together with Carl Severin Mortensen in Moline, Illinois. He was born 23rd of October, 1890, in Ramsossa, Skåne, and came to the United States in 1909. I used to be a farmer. A farmer? Yeah. We lived on a little farm, about 35 acres, and he raised seven children. Seven children? Yeah. And I was like three older, three younger than me. And now, I get two brothers left of when Malmo. In Sweden? In Sweden, yeah. And I visited there when I was seven, nine years of age. And I also went to Finland, and to Visby, Gotland, and to Amsterdam, Haarlem, and then back to Stockholm. And then we took the seaway, the Jyttakanal, over to Gothenburg. And then from there, by train, to Skåne. Yeah, to Malmo, Skåne. So, you were one of seven kids then? Yeah. And so you had to help out on the farm when you were growing up and going to school? Yeah, I worked on the farm. You worked on the farm? I helped with the farm work. So... Luka rover, and sockerbeter. That's how I got to be so strong, I guess. Ja, ja. And I was here, in America, I built over 100 homes by myself. I see. Mostly by myself. You've been a contractor then? Yeah. You built this house you're sitting in? Uh-huh. And I was going to build a house when I had the money coming in and off to build another house, and so on. One after another. And this is the first addition that I laid out. This is called Canview. And then I later, here in this place, I was outside the city. I drilled a well, but three of my feet deep in the ground, to get water for the house. And then, at that time, I supplied the water for 14 homes here. With their well? From the well, yeah. And then, later on, time went on, and I got older, I guess. Then I started another addition. I built a farm. I bought a farm, and I had a farm for about eight years. And then I thought, well, that doesn't bring me a good income. Maybe I can lay down into lots and build homes here. Where was that located, that farm? That's south of Milan. South of Milan? Yeah. And, uh... Down with Hillcrest, honey! And then, finally, I got old, that I couldn't work anymore. The last time I built a house, I was 75 years of age. Oh, you were busy up in retirement years. Yeah. But before we come into the... What was the reason you left Sweden? What? What was the reason why you left Sweden? Oh, because I wanted... This is a land of opportunity. How did you know that? Well, my father had two sisters that lived here. In Moline? Yeah, in Moline at that time. And, uh... So he thought he would move over here, too, before I was coming to the war. And, uh... But then he got married when he was 40 years old. Oh, I see. And he got a wife when I was 20. And, uh... So time went on, and... And my older sister came to this country about 10 years before we even went there. And he took me back to Sweden and to my home and took me and my brother Gus over here. What was her name? Huh? What was her name? Your aunt's name? Aunt's name? Yeah. Anna. Anna. One was named Anna. Mortensen. Mortensen. Mortensen. One was named Anna. Mortensen. And the other one was Anna. Yeah. Mortensen. Were they married? Yeah, they were married. They were married. Yeah. What was the last name? Their last name? I don't know their last name. You don't know? No. Remember that. Because they lived in Hampton. In Hampton? Yeah. And I visited there. I went into World War I when I was 21 years old. No, 29. And I was over in France 14 months. And then I come over here back home again. And it took, in a way, I got an opportunity to visit a certain France, Monaco. And I was there for a while. And I lived at a town named Hampton. It's across from Italy. And then from there we went back to France in New York. And when I was older I bought a violin. And I got upstairs. And I haven't played it for many years. Were you in any battles during the First World War? No, I wasn't. So you were outside the battle line? Yeah, because I was too old for the part. I was 29 years old. I worked on the arsenal over here. And I guess that's how they got my name. And so I got drafted into the 19th Engineers. You became a citizen then immediately? Huh? You became a citizen then? No, I become a citizen when I've been five years. Five years? Yeah. And then after being 10 years, then I went in the Army. I was 19th Engineer. So if we go back a little bit before you left Sweden here, you and Gustav, your brother, went along with your aunt. Yeah. She paid for it? No, with my older sister. Your older sister? Emma. Emma. So who paid for the ticket? Could you do that yourself? Yeah. I'll tell you, when I learned the trade over there, I got about a dollar and a half a day. In Skåne? Yeah, a kronor. Kronor, yeah. Yeah. That was pretty hard to save up to a ticket, though. Were you able to pay for the ticket yourself? Yeah, we paid for the ticket. And Kristi paid for the ticket, too. Oh. And we went to Copenhagen. Copenhagen? Yeah. And you had no trouble to get the papers? No. And then from Copenhagen, we went by boat to Grimsby, England. What was the name of the boat? Oh, that's a small boat. Small boat? Yeah. And from Grimsby to Liverpool? Huh? From Grimsby to Liverpool? No, from Grimsby to Liverpool. Yeah. And then we stayed there for one night, I guess. And then we went on the big ship, Mauritania. Mauritania? Over here. Oh. And we went here in four days and ten hours. Oh, that was... It was a record trip. But on the way over here, on the sea somewhere, something rammed into the port holder and cracked the glass. And so it got on me and I was on the cabin. He said, guess what's the matter? I got a piece of water splashing on me. But I was right under the port holder, so I said, I can't feel anything. But it ran down on the floor. And in the morning, all socks, they flurried from one place to another. And the cabin boy come in and speak to us in English. I couldn't speak English at that time. And his eyes were the biggest sores. Look what happened. And well, he said, we're going to clean that up. And so that's that. Then we went to Ellis Island. And there are some fish coming to meet us. They could be dolphins. And they jump up in the water and down, up again and down, to the ladies in the harbor. So they were right in the harbor. Right in the harbor the dolphins were? We went to Ellis Island first. First, yeah. And what happened there? And the Statue of Liberty was five years away then. But now it's a hundred years. So did you, you saw the Statue of Liberty then? Oh, yeah. Did you think anything special about it? Did you know about it before you came in there? Because this is the first time you saw it? This is the first time I saw it. You never seen a picture of it? No. What did people tell you about it on the boat? Huh? Were there people on the boat you could talk to in Swedish? No. There was some Polish people. Polish immigrants? They said I'm smoked with weed. Out in the open air on the big ship. Oh. Yeah. So when you came into Ellis Island, what did they, did they check you over then? Yeah, they checked me over. You had to take the shirt off? No. No? So they took me along. He can pass. And then they went. So there were no problems? Huh? No problems? No. So they had all the papers with you? Yeah. Did you have to show any money when you came in? Money? Yeah. No? No money. So they... They had no money that I know of. No. Yeah. So that was it. So you and your sisters, no, Gustav, your sister and Gustav, your brother. Yeah. They went along all the way on Ellis Island. Yeah. To different offices or... Yeah. Passing up there. Uh-huh. Uh-huh. And what happened then? Did you eat there at Ellis Island? Did you eat anything at Ellis Island? How long did I stay? Yeah, how long did you stay at Ellis Island? Well, we stayed long enough to be taken care of and go to New York City. And then from there, we went by train to here. To Moline? Yeah. Oh. That's a long trip. It was a long trip. You didn't sleep much then? Huh? You didn't sleep much then on the train? No, no. No, we had to take it off. Did you have any food with you from Sweden? Food? Yeah. No. You didn't pack anything in Sweden? No, they fed us at the boat and we went. Oh. So... So when you left Sweden, what did you pack down in your suitcase? I had a big suitcase about this high. Oh. And... What did you have in it? And... I had my clothes in there for one thing. And then I had a small rifle that I bought in Sweden. But it was made in Belgium. It's a.22 caliber. And I used that very much over here. And then my brother Siegfried in Malmo, he liked to have it because he thought that it was a pretty good weapon. It was simple to use. What were you using that for? Shooting rabbits or...? I used the rifle to shoot sparrows with. Sparrows? Yeah. And it was... You had to be a good shot to get a sparrow. About 30 feet. Oh, I see. It was used for fun, though, you did that? Yeah, it was used for play, so... Oh. But... And they cut...? I took quite the care of it. And... So I sent it over to him. But I never needed it in Malmo. So when you came through Ellis Island, they didn't say anything about the rifle, though? No, they didn't open my... They didn't open up anything? In this case, no. Nothing at all? No. But as I came home from World War I, they... I had some stuff down on the train to take with me home, but in France they had 75 cannons. And I took the sides for that. You looked this way and the sides that way. But my oldest boy, Dwayne, he was in World War II. And there was Norman, my youngest boy. He was in the army, Patton's army. And he came home all on his mind. He was shag-shocked. I see. And he's in the mine, IVA, Veterans Administration Room now. I see. But being that Dwayne was in the Navy, he got home in pretty good shape. So he lives up in Woodridge now. So, when you came here to Moline then, when you came to Moline, your aunts met you at the station? My uncle. Your uncle? My uncle. Jeppa Mortensen. His name was Jeppa. Jeppa? Jeppa Mortensen. That's a strange name. It's a Danish name. Jeppa, huh? With scurvy. He was born to them, but for some time. But being that he was a land contractor in Sweden, he decided to take that province in with Sweden and make it complete. How about your name, though? Severin? How did you happen to get Severin in your name? In the Swedish almanac, they had names for each day. And my mother, she found that day to be interesting, so she gave me the second name, Severin Mortensen. Is the 23rd of October? Yeah. Oh, that's why you received that name. That's right. So, your uncle here in Moline, what was he doing, Jeppa Mortensen? Well, he worked in a factory. Jandir? In Moline, Minneapolis. Minneapolis, Moline? Yeah. Moline, Minneapolis, I think. Uh-huh. I'm going to go out and get that picture. You have to open the window. So, what did you do then when you came here to Moline? That was the first time you saw United States close up, so to speak. I come here in September. In September 1909? Yeah, when I was 19 years old, but in another month, I get to be 20. Uh-huh. And then, my brother Jan, he had an accident. You had two brothers here, Jan and Gustav? No, I had Jan. He was here before. Before you came? Yeah, and Gust before. Oh, Gust? I and Gust come here. I see. Yeah. And... So, what was he doing, Jan? What kind of work did he have? Well, he was supposed to be a carpenter. Carpenter? Yeah, also a bricklayer. Uh-huh. But he worked with a man that was a contractor in those days, and he worked on a machine, the carpenter work. Uh-huh. And he accidentally got his hand molded up in the machine. Oh, you did? Yeah, and it's taken over there. You mean Jan? Yeah. I see. So, he, until later, just before I got to America, he worked in the factory, a mill in Minneapolis factory, farm machinery. What kind of work was he doing then with just one arm? No, he was an assistant to the manager of the factory, a dead part of the factory. So, he was working in the office then? Yeah. Oh, so he had a pretty good job. Yeah, he got a good job. So, when you came, did you take care in the boarding house, or did you rent a room, or how did you...? Well, my uncle... Jeppa? Jeppa, yeah. We were there about six years, but they got so much older that they thought we better move to another place. Well, they were getting older? Yeah, very old. They'd been here for many years? Oh, yeah, many years. And then we found a room on 15th Street and 20th Avenue, 21st Avenue, with a man named Clark. Clark. And so, we were there for about seven years, but Jan moved downtown a little later, but I stayed with Clark for quite a long time. So, that area up around 15th Street and 20th Avenue, was that a farm area at the time, or was it a new housing development? No, that was... Built up? In the city. It was built up? Yeah, in the city it was. And I helped build on top and down below, so it being closed. He was delivering mail for the post office. Oh. And so, I said, I don't think I can build anything like that. Well, I think you can. So, I built it. So, what did you start out to work with now? You were not a carpenter for Sweden? Oh, yeah, I was a... Oh, you had learned it in Sweden? I had learned it for two years. In Sweden? But being that I had learned it for two years, I thought I was not a complete carpenter. So, whenever they got laid off, things got bad. I was the first one to be laid off, and I got damn tired of that. And I went out for myself to build homes. Did you have to join the Union when you came in then? Oh, yeah. 1909? Yeah. But there was a union. Yeah, there was a union. Carpenters' Union. Yeah, that's right. Was there a strong one, or... Huh? There was a pretty strong union already then? Yeah. You couldn't work without a union card? No, but I quit the union. You quit it? And worked for myself. I got enough money to buy some old homes and repair them and sell them. You mean you've been able to save up money then to buy some older houses and repair them? Yeah. How did you make that kind of money in a short time? Well, I bought one house and then another, and repaired, and so forth. And then I got to get... I had a lot of money coming in. So I didn't have to borrow money from the bank. You could borrow money from the bank? No. I settled it in loan from a bank. Because I wanted to keep the money myself. So when I had money, you know, saved up to build a home, being that I did it all myself, I could build a home cheaper than anybody else. I could sell it cheaper. So you didn't have to go to the bank to get the loan then? No, I didn't do that. You didn't do that? No. How could you buy a home then for somebody? Because you had to pay them cash, or how did you do it? No. Well, I had a loan you didn't pay me for. So that money... You paid in cash? I could pay for that, yeah. So how much were they running then? About two thousand? Yeah, and I could buy for two thousand, maybe sell it for four thousand, five thousand. And you fixed them up then? Yeah, I had to fix them. So... And you were able to buy material cash too? Yeah. You never bought on time? Pay cash for that too. Never bought on time? No, I never bought on time. And then, as I built this, this is up here, I built about ten homes here. In this addition? By myself. But when the war came along, they didn't want me to... They wanted to deal with the real estate man. So I couldn't buy any homes. And that's how Norman and Dwayne... They were your sons? They had to... They went into service in World War II. So how did you manage? You came into the war, First World War, in 1918, 19. Yeah. And then you didn't work anything. You didn't work anything during that time because you were in France. Yeah. And then you came back in 1920, 21, 22. Were they good years? Well... Or were they tough? On the first house, I built them 11,000 in... I don't see... 22nd Street. And I built that out of brick. But I never laid any brick before. But after World War I, they go home, I built that house and put all the brickwork on it too. You mean you laid the brick? Yeah. And you never done it before? No, I never did before. Is it still standing? In the house, it's still standing. But your brother, though, he was a bricklayer. Did he give you some ideas? No, by the way, because he was incapacitated by his one arm. So he had to stay with the factory and then there was a man that lived with him. He owned a 40-acre piece of land out by the Key Lock. Yeah. And so he inherited land from that man when he went away. And he was found then. And we went down and visited him. We took a stroke in my arm below and went down to the creek, down the bridge. And his place was up in the hill there. And so he made a living that way as a farmer. 40 acres? Yeah. Did you tell him where you learned your trade? Mm-hmm. Tell him that you learned your trade in Sweden? Yeah. Yes, he told me that. Did he tell you that? No, he didn't. So he was on the good way to being a full-fledged carpenter when you came here. Yeah. So what did you notice now when you came to this country compared to Sweden? Did they have different tools? Tools? Tools. The tools, the saw and the hammer and the square. Oh, yeah, the tools. They got the saw is a big blade. Yeah. And in Sweden we had a— Hand saw. Yeah, a hand saw with a small blade. And they tied—they'd also be tied by a raft with a pin in there. So I—we went to—we went on Saturday and did some carpentry work, all the little things. And what they saw was—it hit my face because I used my right hand with it. It would— Sight two, continuation with Carl Mortensen, Moline. Sight two. So was it easier to work as a carpenter in this country, you think, than in Sweden? Did they have different ideas on how to put up a house, the framing and the— Oh, yeah. —by horse? Sure. Was it faster to work here? Tell him about the union. It worked faster over here. Much faster? Yeah. Tell him about the union. Oh, yeah. But I—what I could do. So you belonged to the union for 18 years? Yeah. And then you went out of it? And then I went out of it. Uh-huh. And I went to Chicago and I had a $5 cinema packet. And after I paid the fare on the train. And I didn't know nothing about Chicago then. And I lived there for about four years. Was that during the 20s? Huh? Was it in the 20s, 1920s? Yeah, that's in 1920, I guess. Oh. And the mentor on the bus up in Chicago, I asked him if I could find a room to rent. And this bus take you up to the north side. And you can go down and inquire. So I found a room there. I stayed there for quite a long time. But sometimes in Chicago, the work was so far away that I had to get up two hours before. I mean, I need that much time to get the job. On the streetcar? Yeah, on the streetcar. On the streetcar, yeah. Yeah. And, uh... But you were still a carpenter? I was still a carpenter, yeah. Was it easy to get a job then in the 20s in Chicago? Well, after I'd been there for some time, I found a job on building on homes. I mean, apartments, homes. And so I stayed with that for quite a long time. And at that time, Jan got married in those days. That was your brother? My brother Jan. And, uh... And Emma thought that maybe I should send him a present for his birthday. I mean, for his wedding. So I bought some silverware and sent it there. And his wife-to-be-in-law, she had a father. He was a carpenter. So I hired him when I come back here to do some work for me at that time. So they helped out with a good wedding gift that you come in to the in-laws. Yeah. And he, uh... He was a good carpenter. What was his name? Well, I can't think of his name. That was your brother's father-in-law? Yeah. And he built a cabinet for the silverware. So that was very... So you left Chicago and then came back to Moline? Then I come back to Moline again. And then, at that time... You got him old in Minneapolis, didn't you? I built my... My old... This is the first house I built here. This one? In Grandview. About 48 years ago. And this is 38 now. I built about every home in this block and over on 8th Street. Just about every home. So you bought the whole tract of land then? Yeah. And were you able to buy the cash, though? I can't figure out how you get the money without borrowing in the bank. When you buy land outside of the city, it doesn't cost much. Well, there was a farmland here then? Yeah, there was a big farm here. Yeah, there was a big farm, yeah. But the farmer's got to have some money, too, though. He won't sell it cheap because he knows the city is moving in on him. He can make money. How were you able to bargain with him? Well, I think I binked out of him, brought him to the city. I did try and sell the well there. It's about $350. It's still there. How many homes did that serve? 14? No, here. I built about 11. No, I mean the well, honey. The well? 14 homes, I think you said. Did you say 14 homes, Carl? But then in... My god, that is not there. Where, honey? In Milan? Yeah. Hillcrest. Yeah. Hillcrest. Hillcrest. In Milan. In Milan. Yeah. So you bought the whole tract there? He built quite a number of homes out there. You bought the big parcel of land there, too? Yeah, I bought the whole farm. The whole farm? Yeah. How much did you pay for the farm back in the 30s? Must have been about $6,000. And what did you have? Was it during the Depression? Huh? Was it during the Depression? Yeah. How were you able to... You know, everybody else was foreclosed on and everything. And you were still buying. So the bankers, they didn't like Carl Mortensen? Not there. When I bought the farm out in Hillcrest, it was just a farm. It was just a farm. But you saw the value of... There was a fence on it. I took down the fence and built a roof. And out there, I drilled one well 400 feet down. And the man that bought that got that for... I thought I used that well for the number of homes I built out there. But the man that bought the land, he built a grocery store out there. And he had a man to build the grocery store. And then he wanted the wealth too. So I sold the wealth for $1,000. And then I drilled another well that is there now, supplying water. Still supplying water? For those people out there. And it's still good? In Hillcrest. And I built about three small houses a year by myself. By yourself? But you hired somebody, laborers to... for wiring and stuff like that. Pressing and plumbing. I hired that. But the framing and the inside, you took care of yourself? I do that all myself. And then you supply water and roads? Yeah. And that is there yet. That's where I supply water now. I mean, I haven't seen it in about 20 years. And there's one house I built out there. It's called Blake and Paul Jordan. And the people that bought that, they were letting poor folks... they were giving $2,500 to start to build a house for. And they paid the rest on time. And they got the house built. And they closed them in to get it done. And I did. And when I built that house, I sold it for $15,000. And after they had lived there for around 20 years, they sold it, got $40,000 for. For all the inflation in those days. And you gave $6,000 for the whole thing. For the whole lot. Or the whole parcel. But how about... Were you able not to collect from all the people that bought houses from you? Yeah. They were good buyers? They were good buyers. You didn't have any lemons in between there? No. No. And I only charged... 5%? Some... I charged 5%. Oh, I see. You took the loans too then? Yeah. They didn't have to go to the bank? No. The interest was low. The interest was real low. It was only 5%, wasn't it, Carl? Yeah. Yeah, 5 and 5.5%. That's low. Yeah. But it was easier for people then to buy direct through you than go through the bank? Oh, yeah. So you had a bargain there, in other words? There was a bargain. So it was a leverage with. Yeah. Oh, yeah. So how many houses then have you built here? Hundreds of houses? About 12. 12 houses. Yeah, out there. But I mean around here too. You built houses here too. Yeah, and then this block back here on 8th Street, he built quite a number. I don't know exactly how many. About 11. Quite a number of them. 11 homes here. Uh-huh. Yeah. And I took private rental for that. And you know this house he built, and you can see how nice it looks. Yes. You can just see what a good look. You designed them too then? I planned them, yeah. You planned them. Yeah. So I become an architect here. Uh-huh. And. And you didn't belong to the Union after 18 years. You just quit the Union and. And did it. He did it alone. And they never hassled you after that? No. No. Uh-uh. And out there, I have two sons. Yeah. Working with me. They were also carpenters. No. Uh-uh. And they. They just helped him. Helped. They learned to be carpenters. Uh-huh. And they worked for me. And then from Union, my, when this city was over, outside the city, and then man belong to Union, he said, well there's carpenters you got working with you. I said, they are my sons. Well, I said, you can have them work for you. I built this house for me to live in, myself. So, then I set them up. I said, if you don't like it, I might throw a two-by-four at you. They didn't show up anymore. Huh? They never showed up. No. Showed me a few two-by-fours. So, how, you got married what year? To Edith, Carl. When did you get, what was the year you got married? Your first wife's name was Edith. Edith. When I was, oh, I think, 10 years old, she was 19. And I was 29. Uh-huh. And that's when I got married. And we lived together for 48 years. She was my wife for 48 years. She died of cancer. I see. She was not Swedish? No. No? So, how did you meet her? Well, I had the first house when I built here, on Fort Street. When I was 23 years old, I built that. And I bought it for the money from a man named Ulf Roosch. I know who it is. And he became my best friend. And he would lend me money whenever I wanted. And so I built a house for myself on Fort Street. And that is where I am. Well, honey, you didn't tell him how you met Edith. He wants to know how you met Edith. Well, she was adopted by Seymour. And she was about 18 years old then. And so, being that I built the house on Fort Street, I let them live in the house when I went to World War I. And when I come back... You married her? In the... 19s. It would be... then you were 29? Yeah, 29. Then I married her. And you had two sons? And then from there on, he lived with me for 48 years. And she has been dead now since 1968. And two sons? Two sons. One of them was in the war and he got shell-shocked. And he's in a veterans hospital in Des Moines. He mentioned that. And then the other one, the father of those girls there, he lives up in Woodridge, Illinois. Yeah. Two sons, so... And then you married Rosemary Holmgren. That's Swedish. Yes, my parents were Swedish. My adopted parents were Swedish. My real parents were German. Holmgren is very Swedish. And your parents, German parents, died then? Yes, my real mother died when I was two, and my real father died when I was five. And they put me in an orphanage after my father died. My grandmother put me and my twin brother, I'm a twin, in an orphanage in Dubuque, Iowa. And these Moline people adopted us from that orphanage. And the Holmgrens... The Holmgrens adopted us. What was the name of Mr. Holmgren, first name? Winfield. Winfield Holmgren. He was a teacher at Moline High School for a long time, and athletic manager at Moline's Wharton Field House. Were they born in this country? I'm pretty sure they were. But their parents came from Sweden, though. Oh, yes. So you met her, and you've been married for 11 years. Five years after his first wife died, we met. I was his housekeeper for two years, and then I fell in love and we got married. And then you started to build houses again? No. No. But he went... 79 years old, he went over to Sweden to visit his brothers. 79? 79. You were not with them? No, no. I went to Finland first. Yeah, to Finland, yeah. That was before I met him. Yeah. Why did you want to go to Finland? I went to Finland because I wanted to be a tourist and go and see about the land. They used to belong to Sweden in the Bacchan centuries. So you were interested in history? Huh? You have been interested in history, or Sweden's history? Are they part of Denmark and Finland, and Sweden? Yeah, and Finland is the only one that didn't become a Lusia. Because they defended themselves pretty good, but they lost some of the land to the Lusia. But when I come to Finland, Helsinki, Finland, I didn't know where I'd go from there. But there's a little lady named Kisina. She... She was from Finland, wasn't she? She's a tourist guide over in Finland. She took us down to various places in the country there. And then I and a Norwegian fellow from Florida, he and his wife come. He was a big, big company of clothes, so he was always satisfying. And he went out among the people. And he showed off like he was the real guy. But I was there nine years then. And I was in Finland for about 19 days. But you also visited Sweden and your brother. And then... Two brothers. Then from Finland, the tourist guide, she sent me on a trip to Gotland, Sweden. And from there I went to Amsterdam, Haarlem, on the Netherlands. And then from there I went back to Stockholm. And then we went on the Jutland Canal to Gothenburg. So how long did you stay with your brothers then? We were brothers about 12 days. 12 days. Yeah. And you haven't seen them for many, many years then? No. That was his young boy. Oscar, he went hiding when we went to America the first time. But this time he was an old man. Back in Luka and Siegfried, he was an old man too. And Oscar is now 91 years old. 91? Yeah. How old is Siegfried, Carl? He's five years younger. Five years younger than Oscar. He's 86. So they are still living, yeah? Time in the past. Yeah. Well, you got married to Edith Seymour. Yeah. Where did you marry then? What pastor married you? We went over to the temple. The temple? Yeah. So you didn't belong to a church here on this side then? No. No? Did you join the church after you got married? No. You were in the church? No. No. No. We went to church, but didn't join it. Didn't join it. Yeah. He went to a couple of Lutheran churches here in Moline off and on. He wasn't a member, I don't think. He just off and on they went to it. But I was still alone when I bought the beautiful caramels that I got. No, I bought it in 1969. A Buick? He bought a Buick LeSabre. It's out in the back garage out here. Oh, I see. It's a LeSabre he bought in 1969. That was the year after she died. I see. But being that I lived alone, I would go out and have breakfast. I didn't want to be alone in the house. I went downtown to the sidewalks called Steps and then a little foresty thing over there. So I fell down and broke my hip and some people come along, the man and his wife, and there's a part that I couldn't get up as I fell down. But they asked me, where is your arm now? I said it's right over there, but I had broken it. So with his help, I come to the car. When I come to the car, he said, now I can go home. With a broken hip. He couldn't drive in that condition. He broke a hip. But I had to go there. So I went back to the hospital. They called an ambulance and took him to the hospital. Who took your car home, honey? Did the man drive your car home? No. That's a woman named... Oh, Mrs. Wilkins' son took it home, didn't he? Huh? Mrs. Wilkins' son. Yeah, Mrs. Wilkins. Now, about the Vasa and Viking here in Moline, did you join any of those lodges, the Swedish lodges here in Moline? No, he didn't. Like the Vasa Order, they have lodges here. Yeah. No, you never joined those? No, I went down there. Yeah, but you never joined them? I didn't join them. Oh. No. So what kind of insurance did you have now when you first came here? Insurance? Yeah, for hospitalization, when you like, you broke your hip now. What would have happened if you had broken the hip in 1922? Huh? Would you have been able to pay for the... He didn't have any insurance then. No insurance? Uh-uh. No. You were just a free man? Yeah. In fact, he doesn't have any right now. We don't have insurance, do we, Carl? No. No? No. You never had insurance? No, never did. Uh-uh. Because I don't... You've been a fortunate man, then? I can say my life is fortunate. Uh-huh. So you have the philosophy, you save up your premiums, pay them, put it into the bank? Yeah. Uh-huh. Oh, yeah. I figured things out pretty good. And they worked all right? Yeah. Uh-huh. I'm a very, very fortunate man now. Uh-huh. You have a... I'm a very, very fortunate man now. I'm a very, very fortunate man now. You have a... I'm a very, very fortunate man now. You have a... I'm a very, very fortunate man now. You have a... I might be a millionaire. Oh? Yeah. I haven't gotten it up yet, but I could be. I drive, see. I have a car of my own. Oh, you don't drive the Buick? I don't drive the Buick. I have a Chevy, 67 Chevy. And when he gets all his checks, I add them up and take them to the bank for him. Oh, I see. So you are the... She is also the secretary, then? Yeah, I'm the secretary. She takes care of the cooking and the... Yeah. I tell you, fortunately, I can walk on my leg. It hurts a little bit, but I can walk on my leg. I can walk on my leg. I can walk on my leg. I can walk on my leg. I can walk on my leg. It hurts a little bit. I can walk on my leg. It hurts a little bit. But I can, I get along pretty good. You can go to the bank and... I can go to the bank. I can't buy my groceries. We have a boy do that. I see. I suddenly had to stop. I just couldn't. My leg couldn't take it. So we have a boy do that. But I do go to the bank in my car. So seeing over the years now, you have been pretty fortunate that you only had this hip injury. Yeah. You've never been to the hospital other than that during your life? No. Honey, you had prostate trouble. He had a prostate operation. You had a prostate operation. Prostate? Sure. Prostate gland. I wonder if they'll know this. Well, he wanted to know that. But other than that, you didn't have any hospital stay then, so you've been fortunate. No, I'm in Social Security now. And that pays most of it. The Medicaid, yeah. And the rest of it I can pay myself. So... I get good income, maybe $3,000 a month. There are layers around your foot, honey. So politically speaking now, have you been a Hoover man or a Roosevelt man? Hoover. Hoover? Oh, yeah. You voted for Hoover? I'm a Republican. I see. You've always been a Republican? Yeah, always have been. How come you sided with the Republicans? Well– Somebody must have told you that from the beginning because– Maybe a rich Republican. I don't have to pay so many taxes. You know where the paying tax is? No. Oh. About $35,000 a year. You pay that? Yeah. He's in the highest bracket. They call it 50, I think. He's in the highest bracket. That's what the man that does our taxes says. So your philosophy has worked all right then from the beginning. When you came here from Skåne, you got the right philosophy right away. Stay away from the banks as much as you can. Where have you invested the money then? In land or houses or– I invested with the bank. With the banks? But you never borrowed anything? I mean certificates. They pay most interest. I see. It used to be they get 9% or 10% interest on that. It goes faster now. Now it's down to about 6.5% in certificates. So have you been interested in following the stock market and the treasury bonds? No. No? They never bothered you? Out there. There's a bank, the bank of the Tri-Cities. Putnath and Bank of Tri-Cities. It was a person in 1930. That's the only bank of them in those days. And if you put money in the bank, you didn't get no interest for a few months. But after a few months, you get about 3% interest. And now I can talk to you about the banking account, the first national Tri-Cities. That bank wanted to buy the farmland that I bought. And they wanted a crop with the land. But I bought the farmland with other crop at the same price. And so I got it. You got it. You are smarter than the banking people. And my wife, Edith, I didn't have the money when I went out to the farm. And she said she has $5. I said, Well, we only got $5 to rid us. Is that what you want us to pay down on the farm? And she said, Yes. So I bought the farmland, paid them time. And in those days, the interest wasn't much up on the farmland. And so I paid for the farm. And I had it for six years, that's the farm. But I thought that didn't help me anything. Did you farm yourself out there then? Did you live on the farm then so you could farm it yourself? No. You rented out the land then? I rented the land out, yeah. But you didn't pay? No. You didn't?
