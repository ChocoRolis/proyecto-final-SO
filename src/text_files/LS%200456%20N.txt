Here, in Rappford. Yes. You taught Lutheran in Sweden? Yes, I was there. So you went and read and what you did for church? Yes, in Rappford. Did you go to Swedish school in the summer or other day school? Yes, in Swedish school, I had English as well. I see. Were you confirmed in English? Yes. So your mom and dad now speak in Swedish all the time? Yes, all the time. I see. So you had to speak Swedish as well? Yes. All the children speak Swedish? Yes. Your sister? Yes. She writes and reads and everything. My sister. I can only speak and I can't read. And you can't write either? No, I can't write. Have you been to Sweden? No. But your sister has? Yes, two or three times. Do you have any relatives left now? Yes, I have cousins. Yes, cousins, only eight or ten. That many? Yes. Do you write together? Yes, my sister wrote last month. I see. So you know what's going on. Yes. Did you go to any of the associations in Urakpo with your parents? No. You didn't go to Leida and Viking? No, they have left. Not Vasa either? No. Gotemplare? No. Did you have any Swedish newspaper? Yes, I used to have a Swedish newspaper. Mifonsvenden? Yes, Mifonsvenden. The Swedish American Tribune? Yes. So you grew up and went to school here in Urakpo. Did you go to Hörman Halström High School? I went to Jan Nelson. Jan Nelson? Yes, the Jackson School, the White School and the High School in Linden. What did you do for a living? Did you go to high school? No, I worked all year. I see. My father was poor, I couldn't do any work. Did you help your father paint? No, I didn't paint. You didn't? No, I was a cement worker. You were a bricklayer? Yes. A cement worker? Yes. I paced. You paced? Basement floors? Yes. You can speak English, it's easier. It's like mixing and temper up the mortar. And don't break my arm, you know, temper up. So that's what you started with? Yes, I stuck with that. But then I worked in the furniture factory here for a while, before I quit school. Empire or Scandia? Well, that's cabinet. And mid-stage furniture, I made mostly radio cabinets. I see, that was during the 30s? Yes. 19... 1975. 1975. It was a rough time then during the Depression. Yes. But you were able to keep going though. How long have you been here? You mean here in Rockford? I've been here a couple of months. A couple of months? Yes, here in Rockford. And then you're going back to Sweden? Not yet. When? I've got to talk to a lot of people first. When? Well, they probably won't be until next year. Oh. As long as I can stay with Baker, you know, I'm staying. How did you know him? In Sweden? Well, no, I met him here in Rockford. Oh, yeah? So then you continue with... Then you quit the furniture factories in the 40s? Where do you live now in Sweden? Broland or two? Now? No. So you quit the factory work during the war or were you... Yeah, I was in the war four and a half years. Four and a half years? I was three years against the Japanese. In the Pacific? In the Pacific. Did you enlist or were you drafted? I volunteered for one year. Oh, I see. But then they kept me until the war was over. Oh. So you were on the islands then in the Pacific? Yeah. I was in Australia. Oh. And then I went to New Guinea, the Philippines, and then I came back home. And you came home without a scratch? Yeah, but I had malaria. I was sick there four times, malaria, fever. Oh, so you had the shots and they didn't help? They don't help. No? No. The mosquitoes were big enough to carry you away almost. Well, they were big ones. Oh. And when you got bit by one of them, you got bit. So then you had to be in the hospital a long time? Oh, yeah. At least three weeks. And then you were back in New Guinea? Yeah. And you were four times in the hospital, you said, for malaria? Yeah. And I got my health, my medical health records here from the Army. But you didn't get a relapse then after the war where you came back home? Once or twice, a little bit. Without even being bit by a mosquito, you get it back again? Yeah. Oh, I see. Yeah. And there's like a fever and you get... Oh, you get deathly sick. You shake, you vomit, and you can have ten blankets on you. And you still freeze? Still freeze, shake. And there is no shot that can prevent it? No. But then they come out with a new pill they call Arabin. Before they had quinine. That was terrible. That made you deaf for about five or six minutes. It affects your hearing. You had to drink the quinine? No, you took in the pill. In the pill. And they give you Arabin. That was a yellow pill. Oh. And you took long enough, you turn yellow, and the yellow is this wall. Oh. So there was strong stuff. Oh, yeah. But you came back then? Yeah, I was there three years overseas. What kind of work did you get done when you came back here to... I went in the machine shop, but I couldn't stand that. To inside you're closed in. After being in the Army, you're out in the fresh air. You were used to the open space. Yeah. And I got hooked up with a contractor, and I left for the government up in Greenland. How did you get that job? Well, they put an ad in the paper, and you passed the test, you was hired. So I got hired. And you were a cement finisher, too? Yeah. That was owned by Denmark. Yes. And the Danes come over there, and we placed us, because Eisenhower fired us, because we was making too much money up there. You were fired? Yeah. So they hired the Danes for a dollar an hour. That's about five kroner, isn't it? Yeah. An hour. How much did you get, though? 25 kroner an hour. Then. How could they fire you? You were American citizens. Sure. Eisenhower, the president. So you had to come home, then? Yeah. How long were you there? The first time I was seven months, and the next year I went about eight months. Were you unionized then in the work up there? No. And they still fire you? Yeah. Well, I was run by the government. The government tells you, hey, we're hiring the Danes for a dollar an hour. Why should we pay you big money? So what did you say? You didn't refuse to take? Well, we had to go by orders. Take it or leave it. So if you had said, I'm going to go for 75 cents, you would have got the job? Yeah. Was it a hard job? No. Well, we built a, just like a city, we built a barracks, hospitals, pumping stations, radar stations, gun emplacements. And it was cold up there? In the summer it wasn't. No? In the winter it was 50 below, but it was dry. And you only had the dollar 25 an hour? No, no more than that. $4.50 an hour. $4.50 an hour? Well, the scale here was about $1.75. Oh, I see what you mean there. So, and then you came back down to the United States again? Yeah. And then you continued your construction here? Yeah. And you joined the Warsaw Order? No. No? I joined the Veterans of Foreign War. No Swedish troops? No. No, she does. She belongs to the Leida. The Leida, yeah. Why didn't you join any other Swedish groups here, like the Warsaw Vikings and the Swedes? No, not in particular. He don't drink. No? Not now. Years ago, but now it's no use to join clubs. It's just drinking and dancing and that's all. Yeah. That's all they do. That's all they do now. That's all the club is for, to drink. Get full. Get full, yeah. So you remember some of the old-timers here, Bruce Albin? You remember him? Yeah, yeah. He was a strong guy, they said. He was. Took seven policemen there, all in the jail. I talked to one policeman. He said it only took two. Two? You seen him? Yeah, I seen him. I went to school with his daughters. He had a wooden leg. Oh, I see. How did he lose that leg? Do you know? I think it was in a motorcycle accident. What kind of work was he doing? He was a blacksmith. But then he ended up over here at Dropwoods forging. They make great big, one of those big hammers. So he gets a good practice there every day, then? Oh, yeah. Then he quit forging. He went and bought a lot of property in town. When did he get started with that, being a hammersmith? In Sweden, I guess. He was a blacksmith. From Sweden? Yeah. Well, how come he changed from such a different job? Well, a blacksmith is a past. You don't do that no more. You never see a blacksmith in black. No, they're all gone. That's all done. So he started to sell real estate then? No. He worked at Dropwoods. It's a forging shop where they make castings and all that. Heavy work. Yeah. But then he quit that and started with real estate? No, he didn't go to real estate. He bought real estate. He bought real estate? Bought apartment buildings like this. I see. Invested his money. And then he sold and went to Florida. But his wife is still living. In Florida? No, here. I see. She moved back when he died. So he died a few years ago then? I imagine about ten, maybe. But now when they took seven policemen to handle him there, he was drinking heavy then? Oh yeah. So when he was sober he was alright? Oh yeah. But otherwise you had to walk away from him? Oh yeah. Everybody walk on the sidewalk? Yeah. So he was known in Rockford, the guy then? Oh yeah. Everybody had respect for him? Oh yeah. They knew him. How about the other big guys, you know, P.A. Peterson and you? You probably don't remember him. Well, I seen him years ago. When I was a kid, I remember him. He was tall. He had the control of the furniture business. He had a hand in everything? Oh yeah. He was a smart man. How about the mayors now in Rockford? Harman Halston? Yeah, he's dead. He's gone. He was a socialist? Yeah, he was. There were quite a few socialists there at that time. Yeah, there was. There was a stop sign out there, and they always got squealing brakes. Squealing brakes, yeah. So then you were not interested in playing soccer, for instance, like this over in Sweden? No. You never tried it? I played baseball. Oh, you played baseball? How about wrestling? You were a husky guy, were you? No. You never tried it? No. With David Kahlstrand? No. I used to belong to a Swedish gym club there. Oh. We'd lift weights and put on the gloves a little bit. Oh, boxing, huh? Yeah. Did you ever see Ingmar Jonsson? No. Ingmar? You seen him, too? I seen him on TV or when they had it in the movie house. Oh. You know, they re-broadcasted a fight. Yes. On a movie. The Claw Circuit. Yeah. Oh, yeah. So there were a lot of Swedes here then in the 20s. Yeah. So then you worked in Rockford after the war then? Yeah. In construction? Yeah, mostly, yeah. Cement construction? I stayed in it. You stayed in it? By the way, I worked for Skogsberg's father-in-law. Oh, Hopkinson? Hopkinson. Oh, I see. When he built this addition on the Swedish hospital. And which is now, Olga was there, too, when I was there. Oh, I see. Working. Was he a hog carrier or was he? He was a laborer. Laborer. Hog carrier. He didn't have no hogs then. No? He helped the bricklayers a lot. Mixed the mud and... Tempered up the mortar. Tempered up the mortar. And he did odds and ends. Oh. And Bill Scappell. Oh. He was a good worker. It is a heavy job, though. Oh, yeah. But you were strong enough to take it. Oh, yeah. You had no after effects. You had good knees and... Yeah, so far. Oh. Yeah. So if you meet Bruce Albin out there, you wouldn't walk away on a sidewalk? Yeah. But he was not a big fellow, though, was he? No. He was a little bigger than you. But how could he be that strong, though? He was terrifically strong in his arms, shoulders. He couldn't squeeze them. The cops used to handcuff him to the telephone pole and beat him on the hands with clubs and break his fingers. For heaven's sake. So there was really a war then? Yeah. Was there Paulke Bengtsson? I don't know if it was him or not, no. Is he still living? No, he died. He died. He was about 90. He was 92. He was still... He died last year. Oh. And he was also a strong guy, though. Oh, yeah. He used to wrestle at carnivals, from what I understand. Oh, I see. And circuses before he got to be a policeman. So he started as a regular policeman here in Rockville? Yeah. And worked his way up to be a chief? Chief, yeah. He was tough. Did he come after Barry Green? He was old at the time when they were... Yeah, he'd come after. After him. He was for many years. Yeah. He shot a burger in the back once. Paulke Bengtsson? When he was a policeman. Oh. He hollered, halt. He hollered, halt again. He didn't halt, and he pulled the trigger, got him. He went down? Yeah. Down he went like a ton of bricks. Do you remember anything about the fights the Swedes had with the Irish and Italians on the main bridge? No. Between the west side and east side? That was before your time. Yeah. I didn't know much about that. There was nothing in the 30s? No. Mostly in the 20s. Was it the Swedish street? Oh, yeah. Growing up. You couldn't even talk English on there. Every store you went into was all Swedish. I can remember, we used to go there Saturday nights. It was real, real night out. And I can remember the fish markets, the bakeries, the clothing stores down there. The grocery stores, bakeries. There used to be four or five bakeries down there. Not now. You know Kalisvik? Yeah. You been over there? Yes. Three grounds. Yeah. Here's some Broadway. Yeah, right over here. No. Just a block up. Oh, that's all it is? Yeah. So 7th Street is not too far from here, though. No. Four blocks. Four blocks. Yeah, four blocks. So that was the Swedish area all along there then? All of it. All Swedish. All Swedish. No Italians or Polacks lived there? No. Lithuanians or? No. All Swedish. All of them. Mostly on the east side is all Swedish. This is the east side. And there was no one living on the west side of the Swedes? No. Very, very few. Mostly, then it was mostly Italians. Irish. Polish. How about when you went to school, though? Did you go together with the Irish and Polacks? Yeah. Well, I went to school mostly with Swedes. Mostly Swedes. Because you go to the same neighborhood, you move and live. It's all Swedish neighborhood. So there was not too many Italians in there then? No. There were no school fights? No. How about when you played football, though? Did you play football? No. Or baseball against the west side? No. You never did that? No. We just played amongst ourselves over here in the southeast end part. But the school didn't have any games? No. We played each class, different classes we played. But that's about all. So there was quiet. And once the depression was shook off, there was better times. Yeah. And the war came along. And everybody got rich. Do you think they helped out to make a lot of people rich? Well, you better believe it. But you people, though, they had to go out. You had to take the shift. Oh, yeah. Made all the people rich. Did you get rich, honey? During the war? No. I don't believe in that. The women, they were working in the factories, too, then. Oh, yeah. Full production. Yeah. Took the men. But by that time, the furniture factories were gone, though, more or less. More or less, yeah. They started moving out of here in the early 30s. And they started moving out. What was the reason? Was it the Union that drove them off? Yeah. It was the Union. Yeah. High wages. They moved down south. But were the wages high, though? I mean, they had 40 cents an hour, they said. They were asking 60. They could move down south and get 10 cents an hour. 30 cents an hour, that's a lot of difference. So they just closed up and... Moved out. Are those factories still in business down there? Oh, yeah. They are? Not only that, they're more close to the lumber area, where they grow the lumber. So there was a shortage of raw material there. Yeah. So there was one... That way it would be cheaper to ship. It's right there. Oh. So while you were now working in the cement business, you were a Union man, though, in the... Yeah. Union. How come you could get Unionized? The bricklayers and the carpenters and the plumbers? No, we organized. I know, but I mean, the factory workers seemed to have an awful time to organize. Oh, not now, eh? No, all... No, but I mean in the 30s and 40s. If you talked Union, you were up. Oh, some of them, yeah. They said that Swan Hillman, he told Mr. Swanson, you'd be better off outside, Mr. Swanson, when you talk Union. Yeah. And there's still no Union in his shop. That's right. They had a profit-sharing deal. Yeah, so they worked all right. Oh, yeah. By Southerstown, they had a strong Union. Yeah, very strong. And most of your shops in Rockwood is Union, outside of Barber Coleman. They're not Union? No. Angler's Salts is not Union. But there's very few. Very few. All the rest of them are Union. But it took a long time, though, before they could get a hold in the factory. Yeah. Because they were afraid to lose their job. Yeah. But painters, they were organized in the 1900s, and the carpenters and bricklayers. All the building trades. So you have a pension, all that, when you retired. Well, I took mine out. Oh, you could take the whole thing out? Yeah. Oh, I see. And you take it all out. It's not too personal a question. She has her pension coming. We have Social Security. That's what I live on, Social Security. Oh. You have Social Security in Sweden? Of course. 1914. Since 1914? That's right. Then I got the Social Security check in 1941. Yeah. In 1936 they started. They started, but they didn't pay off until 1941. No. So there are certain things, you know, they were lagging behind. Yeah. In certain. How did it go in Sweden? Did it go by how much you make? Did you get a pension or did you have a flat rate? No, all the same. All the same? I think there is. What if you didn't work at all? Oh, you get the pension. You got to live. So what do you think about the economics of Lackawanna today compared to the Depression in the 30s? It's much better now, though, and nobody is suffering. It's a lot better now, but there's a lot of people out of work. It is. There's a lot of people out of work. They didn't suffer as much as they did in the 30s. No. They have people take, you have like food stamps and you get welfare, and you go down, if you don't have anything, they write out a slip. Site 2, continuation with Ralph Anderson, Rockwood, Illinois. You want to get married now, and you want to take care of... What? What's that mean? Christmas. Maybe. I don't know. So you want to have a Christmas wedding then? I don't know when I'll get married. I really don't know. I might be dead before I'm a bride. That's why you should hurry up. Your man is waiting here now, patiently. We're not doing nothing wrong. We're just companions. Yeah, but you know, he's been waiting all his life not to get a bride. Don't refuse him. He makes you 15 years younger. Put that in the historic book, too. What was the lottery tonight? 873. You played the lottery every... Not every night. I like to look at it on the television. What was the four number? I don't remember. I marked it down somewhere. So how much do you win then? It depends on how much you play. Like if you play, like this house number, 1305, if you play one dollar, you win 5,000. If you play 50 cents, you win 2,500. But they don't come up very often. How lucky you have to be to get three numbers. They may not come up for 10 years. They may not come up for 20 years. Maybe never come up. So this is a good system Governor Thompson has done. Yeah. I think Sweden is a better country to live in than the United States. They help the people more. You think so? I heard that. I heard they're good to their people. What happened to that guy that got shot over there? Pardon me? Yeah. He died. Why did they shoot him? We don't know who did this. We can't ask any questions. Is he a socialist or communist or what? He's a Democrat. Democrat. Like Herman Holmstrom. He was a Democrat too. Did you live in Rockford at one time? No. Have you always been from Sweden? No. You worked for her uncle? Yeah. That statement you said, Nover, is straight to your marriage plans with her. You see? She's happy already. We could have gotten married nine years ago. Why didn't you? Because I think we're too old now. What do you mean too old? It's too hard. I've been through two deaths. I had two husbands and both died. But he's not going to die. One died of cancer. I got married again. He died of a heart attack. So why should I try to get married again? I don't know. I don't know. I had a heart attack, so why should I try to get married again and have bad luck maybe? This way I said, So far, it's good. So far, so good. The pastors don't like it when you live together. The pastor? The pastors. Your favorite pastor. They're not perfect either. No. You don't tell your pastor that you're living. I know more about the ministers than you do. You think so? I know one that got kicked out of the church. Yeah, but you know here in Rockford, they're very churchly people though. Yeah, I said, Why did Rockford get kicked out because he ran with a woman? Boy, I thought they were straight. Straight as an arrow. That's just a job for them. So why are you going to marry now if you get married? No, you are taking this off now. No, this off now. If you are going to get married now, you're going to the mission covenant then? Yeah. No, no, no. I'm a Protestant. I go to Calvary Lutheran Church. Yeah, he's a Protestant too. He belongs to the covenant. He's a Protestant. Well, he's going to do what I do. Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha. Would you like to make a bet? He has a strong covenant though. He don't go to church. No, but he's living in the least though. Yeah. His sister's church he goes. Oh yeah, but they're very... They go to the Baptist church. Yeah. So how about your other, your sister and your brother? My brother, he goes... He lives in Belvedere. Yeah. Is he a covenanter also? He goes to Baptist church. He goes to Baptist. He's the one Henry went to. Oh, I see. But you don't? No. I don't think the Swedes should go to Baptist church. I think they should go to Protestant church. Protestant? Why do you think so? I don't know. It seems like all the Swedes go to Trinity or Emmanuel Lutheran or... I mean, they go to Lutheran church. Lutheran. Do you go to Lutheran? Baptist, that's a very strong fanatic religion. They're very, very strong. You can't do anything out of the way. You mean you will have a fear then when you... I don't have no fear of nothing. I don't do anything wrong. No, but if you belong to that church, then you can feel secure. No, no, no. I don't feel superior. I just live the way I want to live. I tell you like I tell someone else. When you start paying my bills, you can tell me what to do. Oh, I see. See, I'm this type of person. I'm this type of person. I live each day that comes, and I believe in the Lord, but I don't want to be told I have to go to church four times a week in order that I'm going to get better. If I'm going to get better, I can make my own prayer in the bed, and the Lord will answer me. I don't have to go to the church every other day. I don't like fanatic people about religion. I like to have a few at a minimum. If a man wants to go to the ballgame or to the racetrack or wage you $2 on a horse, I think he should be allowed to do it. If you want to take a glass of beer, fine, but he don't drink and I don't drink. I never smoked in my life, but if I felt like I wanted a cigarette, I should be able to do it. I don't believe anyone should tell you how to live your life. You understand what I mean? You're going to marry a good woman here. Yeah. She's very liberal. Yeah. She has good views. I'm not bossy, and I'm good-hearted. I'm like my father. He's a very good-hearted man, but he did what he wanted to do, but if anybody would ask him to do something, it don't matter if it's 2 or 3 o'clock in the morning, he'd get up and dress and go help. See, he was the type that had thousands and thousands of friends. I could show them the books where they signed when he died. They had to stand out in the street to then allow them to hear the ceremony, and they closed the factory where he was the superintendent because everybody wanted to go to the funeral. They closed the factory. They don't do that today. But they did for him because they liked him. What was his name, your father's name? My dad's name was Carl Johnson. Carl Johnson. And he worked for the? He worked for Patrick Prince Mission for 40 years, and he died of heart attack. So they honored his life then by closing the factory down when he died. They all went to the funeral. The men all went. Were they paid, the workers, then, when they went to funeral for a person like that? No. I don't know if they paid. No? They took the day off then. Yeah. They don't do that today. No. I don't know. There were a few hung around there that had to be there, but the majority of them were at the funeral. So I know that. And they had, what was it, about 15 pages in the book with 20 names on every page filled with the visitation. They started coming on Easter Sunday at 1 o'clock, and my mother was still there at 6 o'clock at night. Five hours, the people come and they went and they come and they went. And the next day on Monday, the whole mortuary was full, upstairs was full with a loudspeaker, and they sat outside on the steps and listened. Was he also in the organizations? No, no, no, not much. Not much? No. Was he a churchman, though? No, he didn't go to church much. Why did they like him so much? Because he was a good-hearted guy, good-hearted. He never had an enemy. He never got in any trouble, always helped people out. Where was he from in Sweden? He didn't come from Sweden. He was born here? He was born in Rockford. He was just born here. But his parents were Swedish, though. Yeah. Do you know where they came from? They were from Sweden, but I don't know nothing about them. The grandparents, I don't know. I was too small when they died. And you were the only child? Yeah, but your mother had grandparents. Well, my mother's my father's mother, and they were from Sweden, too, but I don't know what part. I never knew that. Her name was Lundin, wasn't it? Her name was Lundin, and my other dad's father was Johnson. I don't know anything what they did for work. I don't know where they lived. I don't know nothing, because I was only about seven or eight years old or something like that, nine years old. I don't remember. And you were the only child? No, I had a brother, but he died, too. I have nobody now. All my relatives are dead. That's why you need Ralph. I had no children and no aunts or uncles, no mother, father, no sister, no brother, no nephews, no nieces. So you invite me, then, to the wedding. You want to be the first one. The top dollar. Oh, you know that. You might be asked to be best man. You mean I'm going to lead you to the altar? No, you might stand by Ralph. I'll stand by Ralph. He needs some support. You know, he's probably going to say, you've been through so many times. There's nothing new for you. Ralph is big and husky, you know, but he might shake, you know, when it comes to the final moment. When the bell is going to toll. He hasn't got any money now. He's been spending it. He bought a couple of cars, and they were no good. They were lemons. Lemons? Now, I'm going to put this back. What are you going to do? Oh, you mean. It's all tangled up. Oh. Well, that job you got is sure interesting. Sure. You mean to Elmendorf? People tell me the darnest thing. You know. You hear all this politics in Rockford now. Were you, were your father interested in politics? No, he wasn't. He never. He voted Democratic all the time now. He was a Democrat. He was against Republicans. But there were a lot of Swedes, so there were Republicans. And I used to be a precinct committee man. You? In my ward. Oh. In my precinct. So you were interested in. Yeah. I was strictly Democrat. And you had a precinct committee man covering in the precinct probably, let's see, about one, two, three, four, about six blocks square is the precinct. And you take care of that and inform the people who's running and how good a man he is. You mean you go door to door then? Yeah. And tell them? Yeah. How much do you plug it now? I mean to make sure you get the votes. Well, you tell them who's running and what his program is and how good a man he is and how long he's lived in Rockford and all that and his family and he went to school here or whatever. And this precinct man, they go only for bigger elections for the governor and. No, for any election. Any election? Any election. Any. So even. You don't get no pay for that either. Volunteer. But you get a little bit of inducement if you're doing a good job. Oh yeah, but they don't always pay off. Because they can see exactly how you perform though because if you get a bad turnout they blame it on you. Oh yeah. So how did you work out? I worked out all right. I only got so much that I gave it up because I was working long hours and couldn't keep up with it. So I gave it up. Years ago there were a lot of Swedes on the city council and the mayors and the fire chiefs and police chiefs. Nowadays you don't see too many Swedish names in the politics of Rockford. The one that just quit now, his name is Peterson. Was he a. Delbert, his name was Delbert. He was a nice man. Was he an alderman? No, he was. Police chief. Police chief. Peterson. Peterson. Delbert Peterson. He just quit last year. He retired? Yeah. He moved to Florida. And he was on the force for, I remember the first night he come on the police department. It was in 46. He started out as a regular police cop? Yeah, he had his beat, yeah. He had his beat on 7th Street. They were walking at that time? Yeah. No squad cars then. He had motorcycles. But he only had about, was it four or five. The town wasn't very big then either. It was 20th Street? 20th. 20th Street was, was the. Kind of like a line, maybe a little further out. Not far, just a little further. So there was corn then, east of. Oh, they had lots of fields out there. You know where. About 25, 10 streets. Where Baker lives now. How far? That was all cornfield. Before the war. And then after the war, he started to grow when they came back from service? Yeah, he was in the Army here. So he bought that house for peanuts where he lives in. To the veterans, to the government. So he was baking biscuits in Texas? Yeah, in the Army. He had it made. I don't know.
