 We have 11th of July 1986 and I'm sitting together with the good of years of Modena, Illinois. She was born 1894 3rd of August in Lund, Northwest Jutland and came to United States in 1901. Yeah. And if I ask you, you know, Miss, we can speak Swedish. Oh yeah. How old were you when you came from Sweden? I was 5 or 6 years old. Something like that. What was the reason that your father got emigrated? What was the reason he left Sweden? Oh I don't know. I don't know. We had relatives over here and he had a sister over here I think it was before we came over. Did he have a farm in Lund, North? A farm? No. Not that I know of. I don't know too much about it because well. You're too young. Yeah. You remember anything from Sweden? Not too much. I was over there a couple years ago and I got to see the house that we had lived in but I didn't get in it. But my brother went over just a few years after I'd been over there and he got into our old home. It was the same home? Yeah. Same home. So how many children were you now when your dad left and mother? How many children were you in the family? We were 6 children. 6 children? Yeah. How many boys? One boy. He and I are the only ones living. He lives here in Moline. Moline? Yeah. Is he older than you are? Two years older than I. Two years older. So he remembers a little bit more than perhaps about the travel and? Oh I don't remember too much about it. How about he? Does he remember anything? Oh he remembers a little bit but I don't know. Not too much. So you came over here then, the whole family? Yeah. Were all the children born in Sweden? Yeah. I had one sister younger than I and she's gone too. And they were coming to then, did your dad have sisters here or your mother or who did you come to now? Well my dad had a sister here. Here in Moline? Yeah. And she was married then too? Yeah. I can't remember what her name was now, Fall I think. So you got an apartment here in Moline then or did you? We got an upstairs apartment down on 2nd Street. Yeah. Way down on 2nd Street, that's a long time ago. Off of 2nd Avenue some place down in there. Just on the side of the tracks, north of the tracks? Yeah I think so. So then you had to start school there? Oh yeah. And did you talk Swedish then in your home? Oh yes. Even in later years to your parents? Oh yes. While my dad was here we talked Swedish quite a bit. All the time? Yeah. So what kind of work did he get now? Carpenter. Carpenter? He was a carpenter for Sweden? I don't know what he was in Sweden, I don't know. But he got carpenter work here in Moline. So that was all he did then? Yeah. Built a lot of the houses around. Did he work for somebody else? He worked for somebody else. And then he would take the jobs on by himself too, some of them. To build houses? Yeah. So he built his own house pretty soon too then? Yeah. And then you moved from 2nd Street to? Yeah. Where was it? On 13th, 7th Avenue someplace there. So long ago I don't remember. I'm the only one, well I got my brother still living but we can't get together too much. So he still lives in his house or? He lives, well he lives with one of his in-laws. Yeah. And right now I think he's in a home sometime because he hasn't been real good. So you went through school then in Moline? Oh yeah. There were no Swedish lessons in school at that time? No there wasn't. You couldn't take any Swedish? No. Not in the school, we could have gone to a Swedish school someplace I suppose but we didn't. The church school? Yeah. Did your family not join the church? Oh yeah. The first Lutheran? No, the free church. Oh the free church? Yeah. I see. Always been in the free church. Were they in Sweden too? It was Swedish too then. Yeah. In Sweden? Oh in Sweden. They just belonged to the regular church then? Yeah in Sweden we did, as far as I know, I don't know too much about it. But here it was the free church? Free church, uh-huh. So you went to Sunday school there? Yeah and I still go there. Oh, on 7th street? Yeah. And you were confirmed there also? Yeah. Do you not remember having any summer school in Swedish at the free church? Oh there was I think but I never went. You didn't have to because you were taught Swedish with your parents? Yeah. Were there a lot of Swedish spoken out on the streets at that time when you were in the 1910 and 1915? Oh I don't know, I suppose there was. We did at home. But there were a lot of Swedes there though? Oh yeah, I guess so. More than all? Yeah. So after you went through high school? No, I went through eighth grade. Eighth grade. How about the rest of your brothers and sisters? I mean your brother, did he go through? My brother went through just the eighth grade. Yeah. And the rest of the sisters too then? Yeah. So what kind of work were you getting then after you? I worked, I worked clerked in a grocery store first. I worked there for quite a while. Was there a Swedish grocery store? No, it wasn't Swedish but I, there's a lot of Swedes that came in there. So you could talk Swedish to them? Yeah, that was at Five Points, if you know where that is? Where? Five Points. Five Points? 15th street and 7th Avenue. Yeah, that's where I worked. There was a grocery store on the corner there at that time. And then in the middle of that block between 14th and 15th street was a bakery. And my sister worked there. And then there was a shoe store, Carl Salin's shoe store. And oh, I helped in there when I had, wasn't working in the grocery store, when I had days off or something, I'd help in there. So, always had a job. And did you join any other organizations here of Swedish background like Vasa? No, no. Only the Free Church? Free Church, uh-huh. So your parents, they participated there? Free Church. Often and like your father, was he on the board of the Free Church? Yeah, he was on, oh yes, uh-huh, yeah. Of course, our mother died, I think, was the first year that we were here. Your mother? Uh-huh. I see. What happened to her then? She got somewhere? Well, I think when we came here, they put us in a place on 2nd street, off of 2nd Avenue there. It was a big house and it was a two-story house. And we lived upstairs and there were steps on the outside of the house. We had to go up those steps to go upstairs. And I always, always say and always think that that's what killed my mother. Had to carry the water up and from down below and she got so she couldn't take it. She was in bed for a long time. She died then? Yeah. And your father, he was able to keep your children together though? Oh yeah. Did he hire some maid or? No, my sister, older sister, she was about 13, 14 years old, she took over. I had another sister, was a little few years older, but she had to work out. So. There was a lot of responsibility for your sister though to take care of the home and fix the food and washing? A lot of, yep. And she did that? She did that up until, oh my goodness, I can't remember when she was married. She hasn't been gone so terribly long. Oh, she's been gone oh she's been gone about 15 years or something like that. But she stayed home then? Yeah and took care of. Until she married? Took care of the family, yep. And then when you got old enough, you also helped to pinch in them to help out? Oh yeah, got a job outside though. Got a job in the grocery store for a long time. And then after the grocery store business, you went to John Deere? I got to John Deere, got into John Deere. And that was in the office of the Parks Department? Yeah. And you worked there for 40 years? 40 years. So you were never laid off then during the Depression? No. You always had a job? Always had a job. How much did they pay you now? Monthly wages? Monthly wages, yeah. I can't even remember what I got. I don't know. But it was a safe job, you know. You had a paycheck, I mean. Oh yeah, I got a check. Every other week or? Every, I think every two weeks. Every two weeks? Yeah, I think it was. And you lived at home then at that time? Yeah. Yep. Yeah. And then when you met Walter Beers, you know, you married him in the 19... in the 20s or? 19, when did I get married? 19. I can't even remember that anymore. 1940 something. 1940? Yeah, what did I say before? Well, you didn't say anything. Oh, I think that's what it was. So you married late then? You were... Oh yeah, yeah. I see. Yeah. Well, we had to work. Our mother died. I mean, my... yeah, and we had to help take care of the house. So your older sister, she married them? Yeah, she got married, but she was about... when our mother died, she was about 14 years old, see. And she had to take over the family. So how long did she stay home then before she married him? Oh, I don't know. That's a long ago. I don't remember that. No. Did she marry the Swede or? Yeah. Almquist. Almquist. Yeah. So then she set up her own household. Well, no, they stayed at home with us. Oh, they did? Yeah. Almquist too? Yeah. I see. So there was a big house enough then so they could live upstairs? Yeah. Well, we had enough stairs. There was a big house with enough stairs, down the downstairs, and then a basement. Oh, you had three apartments then? Yeah. So this Almquist, what kind of work was he doing? Almquist, let's see, he worked at John Deere, I think it was. Yeah. So you were doing all right then? You all pulled together and helped out, and your dad was a carpenter? Yeah. How long did he continue to work now after he... My dad? Yeah. Not too long. He got sick and got crippled up, so he couldn't do much. He got hurt? Yeah, yeah. So, but he stayed home with us. Oh, you never know what you're going to have to go through. But I lived through it, my brother's still living. And how about the rest of your sisters now? Did they, they didn't stay home though, the other sisters? Oh yeah, they, my younger sister stayed home and Agnes and Ann, they were, we were all together for a long time. Yeah. They didn't marry? They got married, uh-huh. They got married? Uh-huh. Oh, but then they moved on though? Well, Ann didn't, no, she stayed, she and her husband. Amquist. Yeah. Oh. So that's, uh, that was more than eight years ago? That's my whole family over there, the picture's over there. It's a wonderful collection of... Yeah. So how did you meet your husband? Now he was not a Swede? No, he wasn't a Swede. You mean there were no Swedes left for you when you... No....when you were looking around? Oh, I don't know, I just met Wally and... Where did he work, at John Deere? John Deere, uh-huh. Yeah. So you married in the 1940s and you also had an apartment in your... Yeah, we stayed home....father's house? Yeah, yeah. Yep. And it was on the, what street was it you said, on 15th Street? No, it was on the 15th Street. Oh, okay. What street was it you said, on 15th Street? No, we were off of 7th Avenue and 13th Street. 7th Avenue and 13th Street. Yeah. And their house is still standing? I think it is, I'm not... no, I don't... well, I don't know. I think it's down. I can't just remember. Do you know Ruth Maul at all? Yes. From Butterworth Center? Yes. They lived right next door to us. Oh, they did? Uh-huh. I see. Yeah. Her father died also very... Oh, yeah. In an accident, wasn't it, at John Deere? I don't know just exactly what happened there. But I think of that place down there, and Ruth talks about it too. We were the only ones in the neighborhood around there that had a telephone. And we'd get calls for people a block or two away and we'd run and get them and they'd... So your father was the only one that had a telephone? Yeah, we were the only ones that had a telephone. And it was funny, Ruth still remembers that, how we'd run around. And then there was one man that lived next door to us, his name was Moberg, and he'd come in and use our telephone in the corner there. And he'd stand there and he'd stand there and he'd... you couldn't hear a word he said, he was just listening and seeing. It was funny. Ruth still remembers all that too, years ago. So her mother was living next door then? Ruth's mother, oh, yeah. She had also some... a few sisters more. Yeah, a couple. It was Edith and Ruth and Edna, I think that... I think there was about four of them, four girls there. She got a job at the Butterworths when she was 16 or something like that? Yeah, yeah. So you grew up with her then, more or less. You went to school with her? Yeah. She also talked Swedish? Oh, yeah. Yeah, she worked at Butterworth. I worked at Butterworth Center too for a while, got a job there, yeah. To help out in the kitchen or...? Oh, helped all over there, yeah. It was a big house, it still is. Yeah, yeah, it's still there. Yeah, and then I got a job at Deering Company, so then I quit. Oh, so Butterworth Center at that time, there were people living in it, of course. Yes, uh-huh. It was a hustling place. Yeah. A lot of parties. Oh, parties, I should say. Yeah. So you said that you went back to Sweden to find out, where you... to look at the whole place. It was not open, you said, the house? Well, I didn't get in there. In Lungnose? Yeah, in Lungnose. No, I saw the house, but that was it. And you didn't leave any relation back there? Well, you left cousins or aunts or...? I think there were some there. I'm not sure, I think there were some. But you never had any contact with them? No, no. Well, my dad did. He wrote a lot of letters to Sweden. When did he die? Oh, my, he's been gone 19... Oh, when did he die? By the 1930s, I think, or early 40s, or something, I don't know. He's been gone. I can't just remember. I gotta look that up. Many years ago. Yeah. He lived a long time. He went to free church. And... Did the family talk about Sweden often, when you were sitting drinking coffee and dinner table? Oh, yeah. They talked. We talked Swedish a lot at home. Yeah. So, Papa talked about it? Oh, sure. He spoke Swedish? He spoke Swedish, mm-hmm. Do you remember, like, the table prayer, when you sat down to eat? Yeah. You used the Swedish table prayer then? Oh, yeah. Do you...? Yes, and I'm to boots, we go... I think I did them all before. That was you? Yeah. Did Dad read that one, or...? Well, we'd say it together. All of you? Uh-huh. So, it was done for every meal, and we were sitting down... Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah. How about Christmas now? Did... Was your mother dying very early, though? Yeah, she did. She died. Your older sister had to take care of that, I suppose, when you were growing up. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Do you remember Santa Claus? Oh... If he came to your house? No, but no, we didn't... We didn't have Santa Claus too much. My dad didn't believe too much in that. Did you get any presents at the Christmas? Oh, yeah. Yeah, we all had... Were they under the Christmas tree, though? Well... Did you have a stocking? Oh, no, we didn't have a stocking. I just don't remember how that was, under the tree, I think. And then someone handed out the presents to each one. But they still do that. Did they do it on Christmas Eve or Christmas morning? It's usually both on Christmas morning. Christmas morning? Uh-huh. And then you went to Jyroruta? Yeah, and then Sunday school and church. And it was all in Swedish, then, when you were growing up? Yeah, yeah, uh-huh. You had no trouble to understand the sermon or what they said in church? Oh, no, we understood it. The preachers at that time was on 11th Street and 13th Avenue. 13th Avenue. Uh-huh. That's where we started. Yeah. So they had quite a few members then. Yeah, there was quite a few. And pastors over the years. Yeah. You remember Gustav Johnson? Was he there preaching? Yes, he was, Gustav Johnson. I remember the name, but I can't picture him. Gustav Johnson, yeah. But he was well liked, they said, a good preacher. He was, uh-huh. Yeah. You never went to the Lutheran Church or the Covenant Church? No, we'd go to the Covenant Church Sunday nights once in a while. Evening services? Yeah, uh-huh. Because the Lutherans didn't have any evening services. Well, sometimes we didn't, and then we'd go down there. But the Lutheran Church never had any evening services, though? Well, I don't know too much about the Lutheran Church. Although I just lived a whole couple blocks from there, and the girls I run around with went to the Lutheran Church. How about other kids now, like the Belgian youngsters in school, for instance? Did you go with Belgian kids in school? Yeah. Belgian? Yeah. Oh, there were some there, yeah. But there was not too many, though? No, not that I remember. Because they did, they went to... They had their own school. Local school. Yeah. Sacred Heart. Yeah. Because it was mostly Swedes that you were roaming around with? Oh, yeah. A lot of them. So what were you doing now when you were a teenage girl, for instance? Could you go out at night and walk the... Oh, yeah....door at the stores? Oh, yeah. Yeah, we went out. But you were so many sisters, though, so you all walked together? Yeah, yeah. Did you go to Chicago at any time? Oh, yeah. I was in Chicago several times. No, but I mean when you were young. Yeah, I went up there when I was working. John Deere we get. Oh, I can remember one time we got on a bus. And a whole bunch of us went up to Chicago on that bus and came back on the same one. So you didn't take the train in? Any what? The train? No, oh, once in a while, yeah. Because they had good train service? They had good train service then, yeah. Three hours and you were right there. Yeah, and we got to Chicago, we had to take a cab to get into town where we wanted to go. Yeah. So then you went in on a shopping spree? Oh, yeah. We did. Yeah. At the free church now over the years, they preach in Swedish. Did they have any Lucia festivals, for instance? At the Lucia time, you know? No, well, I don't know. I don't remember. Midsummer festivals? Midsummer festivals they had. They had? Yeah. Did they have the outside the church then? Yeah, yeah. And if I remember it, I'm not sure. But it was outside of the church or it must have been in some park around there. I don't know. That's so long ago that... Because you belonged to the young people at the church though. Yeah. Went to Sunday school and went to young people. And then you went to different conferences in Gainsborough, you're now at O'Neill. Well, we didn't do that too much. We stayed home instead of going out with the... We had to kind of stay home with our mother and dad. Yeah. How about now, did your dad buy a car or...? Well, he didn't buy a car, but we bought a car. The kids did. Yeah. I see. So you learned to drive then quite early. Oh, yeah. I've been driving for so many years. You had a car before you had a driver's license? Oh, yeah. You didn't have to have a driver's license then, you know. It was easy then. Yeah. And then it came so that you had to have a driver's license and... Oh, I had to take a test and I passed that. And... Oh, so long ago, I don't even remember. So John Deere, that was a good place to work then? Oh, yeah. I got a job at John Deere. You stayed with it for four years? Yep. I stayed there. So you were one of the few in the Quad Cities that worked during the Depression because a lot of people were laid off. They were laid... I was never laid off. Never laid off. Never laid off. Uh-uh. How about your brother-in-law, for instance? They worked at John Deere. Were they laid off during the Depression? Well, my brother was a carpenter. He was a carpenter. Yeah. But Almquist, no, he worked at John Deere. Almquist, he... Where did he work? I don't know. You said John Deere? John Deere, I guess, at Bajau. So was he laid off then during the Depression? Oh, I don't remember that, whether he was or not. It seemed like they laid an awful lot off. He must have been, too. I don't know. So your house was one that at first with the telephone? Yeah. We had to run all over the neighborhood and call them to the phone. And we did it. That's the funny part of it. We'd run over almost about two blocks over to 13th Street up the hill there and get somebody to come answer the phone. So they spread the rumors then that the Solanders, they have a phone, so we can call them? Yeah. Yeah. It was funny. It was a lot of fun, anyhow. So your dad, he put in for his business then, in other words, to be able to get business calls, I suppose, you and your dad? Oh, yeah. Yeah. Being a carpenter. Being a carpenter. Carpenter. Until he got so he couldn't work anymore. So he was away from work for a long time. He couldn't do it. And he had no insurance then to take care of it? No, we took care of that. Worked. There was no insurance at that time for anything like that? I don't know. I don't think so. I don't know. It could have been. I don't know. We didn't. My dad didn't believe in insurance too much, so we didn't. Yep. So that was... That's a long time ago. Your husband, though, he was working at John Deere? He was. He worked for the Davenport Water Company. For the Davenport Water Company? Yeah. I see. He was a Davenport man. So the mirror still has a German background. Yeah. Yeah, he worked for the Davenport Water Company a long time too. He never worked for John Deere? No. Nope. Your dad, now, got tricked under. He never came back to Sweden? He never went back to Sweden. He never went back. No. Did he want to go? He didn't want to go? Did he want to go, you think, sometime, he was talking about it? Oh, he didn't talk too much about it, no. He was satisfied we were all together. Oh. Your father, now, he was crippled, you said, from an accident in the... Yeah. Work-related. Yeah. How about the rest of the family? Were you in good health then? You didn't have to go to the doctor too often? Oh, yeah. We were all in good health. All in good health? Yeah. You never had to call to the doctor? Oh, yeah. I worked for a doctor, too, helped out. Oh, you did? Dr. Sloan, uh-huh. That is, I got Saturday afternoon job or evening job when I wasn't working at John... When I had the days off at John Deere. You took extra jobs, too? Yeah. So you didn't have too much vacation then? No, but I had a lot of fun, anyhow. Yeah. You enjoyed your work? Yeah. Did you go on vacation in those days? Oh, yeah. We got vacations. You got... We got time off, yeah. Worked at John Deere. I got, uh... Oh, I got two weeks off. I can't remember. It seems to me we used to get a month off. I used to take two weeks at a time. It's a long time ago. So where did you go on vacation, then, your husband? He took his vacation at the same time, then? Well, he couldn't get too much vacation. He worked for the Davenport Water Company. He had his... He didn't get much of a vacation time off. Oh, so you didn't have to... But......do much of that? Uh-uh. We didn't. Where did you go, then, on vacation when you had a few days? Oh, sometimes we'd go to Chicago. Or, uh... Oh, I guess we had relatives around someplace. I just don't remember. Go on visit. How about your brother-in-law? Is there still living anybody in... Where did he work? My brother-in-law? No, your brother. My brother-in-law. Oh, I see. Oh, I see. Oh, I see. Oh, I see. Oh, I see. Oh, I see. Oh, I see. Oh, I see. Your brother? My brother. He was a butcher. A butcher? Abramson's Butcher Shop. So there was his, uh... Yeah, he worked... Yeah, he was a butcher all his life. I see. Yeah. So he stayed with that? Yeah. And he married who? Oh, Gladys. I can't just remember what her name was. Gladys something or other. No. That's too long ago. So your husband, though, when did he pass away? Oh my, he's been gone about... When Wally died. I can't even remember the years. Quite a while ago. It's a long time ago. Did he talk Swedish too? No, no. He was German. He had to sit and listen then, when you were there? Oh yeah. My dad tried to talk American too. Yeah. But he was quite old, though, your father, when he came here up in the 40s? Yeah, we were six. Well, we had six children, mother and dad. So he must be up in the 40s. Yeah.
